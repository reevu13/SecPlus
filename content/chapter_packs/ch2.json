Objectives: 2.1: Compare and contrast common threat actors and motivations.; 2.2: Explain common threat vectors and attack surfaces.; 2.3: Explain various types of vulnerabilities (incl. zero-day, supply chain).; 4.3: Explain activities associated with vulnerability management (threat feeds, OSINT, info sharing, dark web). Glossary: Attack surface - Any system/app/service exposure that may contain a vulnerability an attacker can target.; Threat vector - The method/path used to obtain access (email, USB, wireless, supply chain, etc.).; APT - Advanced Persistent Threat: sophisticated, well-resourced, long-duration attacks, often nation-state linked.; Zero-day - A vulnerability unknown to the vendor/defenders at discovery time; no patch exists yet.; STIX - A structured format (objects/relationships) for describing threats so tools can process them consistently.; TAXII - An HTTPS-based protocol used to exchange cyber threat intelligence, often STIX."
