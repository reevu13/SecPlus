The more information you have at your disposal and the more hands-on experience you gain, the better off you'll be when attempting the exam. This study guide was written with that in mind. The goal was to provide enough information to prepare you for the test but not so much that you'll be overloaded with information that's outside the scope of the exam.",
      "This book presents the material at an intermediate technical level. Experience with and knowledge of security concepts, operating systems, and application systems will help you get a full understanding of the challenges you'll face as a security professional.",
      "We've included review questions at the end of each chapter to give you a taste of what it's like to take the exam. If you're already working in the security field, we recommend that you check out these questions first to gauge your level of expertise. You can then use the book mainly to fill in the gaps in your current knowledge. This study guide will help you round out your knowledge base before tackling the exam.",
      "If you can answer 90 percent or more of the review questions correctly for a given chapter, you can feel safe moving on to the next chapter. If you're unable to answer that many correctly, reread the chapter and try the questions again. Your score should improve.",
      "Don't just study the questions and answers! The questions on the actual exam will be different from the practice questions included in this book. The exam is designed to test your knowledge of a concept or objective, so use this book to learn the objectives behind the questions."

      "The Security+ exam is conducted in a format that CompTIA calls “performance-based assessment.” This means that the exam combines standard multiple-choice questions with other, interactive question formats. Your exam may include several types of questions, such as multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, multiple-response, drag-and-drop, and image-based problems.",
      "The exam costs $392 in the United States, with roughly equivalent prices in other locations around the globe. You can find more details about the Security+ exam and how to take it at",
      "You'll have 90 minutes to take the exam and will be asked to answer up to 90 questions during that time period. Your exam will be scored on a scale ranging from 100 to 900, with a passing score of 750.",
      "You should also know that CompTIA is notorious for including vague questions on all of its exams. You might see a question for which two of the possible four answers are correct—but you can choose only one. Use your knowledge, logic, and intuition to choose the best answer and then move on. Sometimes, the questions are worded in ways that would make English majors cringe—a typo here, an incorrect verb there. Don't let this frustrate you; answer the question and move on to the next one.",
      "CompTIA frequently does what is called item seeding, which is the practice of including unscored questions on exams. It does so to gather psychometric data, which is then used when developing new versions of the exam. Before you take the exam, you will be told that your exam may include these unscored questions. So, if you come across a question that does not appear to map to any of the exam objectives—or for that matter, does not appear to belong in the exam—it is likely a seeded question. You never really know whether or not a question is seeded, however, so always make your best effort to answer every question."

      "C. The most common reason to disable automatic patching is to avoid issues with problematic or flawed patches and updates. In most environments the need to patch regularly is accepted and handled for office workers without causing significant disruption. That concern would be different if the systems being patched were part of an industrial process or factory production environment. Malicious patches from legitimate sources such as an automatic update repository are exceptionally rare and are not a common concern or driver of this behavior. For more information, see Chapter 11.",
      "B. Logs, along with any file that is stored on disk without the intention of being frequently overwritten, are the least volatile item listed. In order from most volatile to least from the answers here, you could list these as CPU registers, the system's routing table, temp files, and logs. For more information, see Chapter 15.",
      "A. If Ed can cause his target to disassociate from the access point they are currently connected to, he can use a higher transmission power or closer access point to appear higher in the list of access points. If he is successful at fooling the user or system into connecting to his AP, he can then conduct on-path attacks or attempt other exploits. Denial-of-service attacks are unlikely to cause a system to associate with another AP, and a known plain-text attack is a type of cryptographic attack and is not useful for this type of attempt. For more information, see Chapter 12.",
      "D. Site surveys that show relative power on a map or diagram are called heatmaps. They can help show where access points provide a strong signal, and where multiple APs may be competing with each other due to channel overlap or other issues. They can also help identify dead zones where signal does not reach. Signal surveys, db maps, and AP topologies were made up for this question. For more information, see Chapter 13.",
      "D. A hardware root of trust provides a unique element that means that a board or device cannot be replicated. A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is commonly used to provide the hardware root of trust. CPUs and system memory are not unique in this way for common desktops and laptops, and a hardware security module (HSM) is used to create, manage, and store cryptographic certificates as well as perform and offload cryptographic operations. For more information, see Chapter 11.",
      "A. Angela needs to retain a password history and set a minimum password age so that users cannot simply reset their password until they have changed the password enough times to bypass the history. For more information, see Chapter 8.",
      "C. Hot sites are ready to take over operations in real time. Cold sites are typically simply ready buildings with basic infrastructure in place to set up a site. Clone sites and ready sites are not typical terms used in the industry. For more information, see Chapter 9.",
      "B. Embedded and specialized systems tend to have lower-power CPUs, less memory, less storage, and often may not be able to handle CPU-intensive tasks like cryptographic algorithms or built-in security tools. Thus, having a firewall is relatively unlikely, particularly if there isn't network connectivity built in or the device is expected to be deployed to a secure network. For more information, see Chapter 11.",
      "A. A dictionary attack will use a set of likely passwords along with common variants of those passwords to try to break into an account. Repeated logins for a single user ID with iterations of various passwords is likely a dictionary account. A rainbow table is used to match a hashed password with the password that was hashed to that value. A pass-the-hash attack provides a captured authentication hash to try to act like an authorized user. A password spraying attack uses a known password (often from a breach) for many different sites to try to log in to them. For more information, see Chapter 4.",
      "D. Jump servers are systems that are used to provide a presence and access path in a different security zone. VDI is a virtual desktop infrastructure and is used to provide controlled virtual systems for productivity and application presentation among other uses. A container is a way to provide a scalable, predictable application environment without having a full underlying virtual system, and a screened subnet is a secured zone exposed to a lower trust level area or population. For more information, see Chapter 12.",
      "C. Derek's organization is worried about insider threats, or threats that are created by employees and others who are part of the organization or are otherwise trusted by the organization. Social engineering involves deceiving people to achieve an attacker's goals. Phishing attempts to acquire personal information through social engineering and other techniques, and shoulder surfing is a technique where malicious actors watch over someone's shoulder to acquire information like passwords or credit card numbers.

This activity is almost certainly a violation of the organization's acceptable use policy (AUP), which should contain provisions describing appropriate use of networks and computing resources belonging to the organization. BPA is not a common term in this context.

This is where the code should reside before it is released for use. The development environment is where developers work on the code prior to preparing it for deployment. The test environment is where the software or systems can be tested without impacting the production environment. The production environment is the live system. Software, patches, and other changes that have been tested and approved move to production. For more information, see Chapter 6.",

    "paragraphs": [
      "When most people think of cybersecurity, they imagine hackers trying to break into an organization's system and steal sensitive information, ranging from Social Security numbers and credit cards to top-secret military information. Although protecting sensitive information from unauthorized disclosure is certainly one element of a cybersecurity program, it is important to understand that cybersecurity actually has three complementary objectives, as shown in Figure 1.1.",
      "FIGURE 1.1 The three key objectives of cybersecurity programs are confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",
      "Confidentiality ensures that unauthorized individuals are not able to gain access to sensitive information. Cybersecurity professionals develop and implement security controls, including firewalls, access control lists, and encryption, to prevent unauthorized access to information. Attackers may seek to undermine confidentiality controls to achieve one of their goals: the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.",
      "Integrity ensures that there are no unauthorized modifications to information or systems, either intentionally or unintentionally. Integrity controls, such as hashing and integrity monitoring solutions, seek to enforce this requirement. Integrity threats may come from attackers seeking the alteration of information without authorization or nonmalicious sources, such as a power spike causing the corruption of information.",
      "Availability ensures that information and systems are ready to meet the needs of legitimate users at the time those users request them. Availability controls, such as fault tolerance, clustering, and backups, seek to ensure that legitimate users may gain access as needed. Similar to integrity threats, availability threats may come either from attackers seeking the disruption of access or from nonmalicious sources, such as a fire destroying a datacenter that contains valuable information or services.",
      "Cybersecurity analysts often refer to these three goals, known as the CIA triad, when performing their work. They often characterize risks, attacks, and security controls as meeting one or more of the three CIA triad goals when describing them.",
      "Nonrepudiation, while not part of the CIA triad, is also an important goal of some cybersecurity controls. Nonrepudiation means that someone who performed some action, such as sending a message, cannot later deny having taken that action. Digital signatures are a common example of nonrepudiation. They allow anyone who is interested to confirm that a message truly originated from its purported sender."

      "Disclosure is the exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized individuals, otherwise known as data loss. Disclosure is a violation of the principle of confidentiality. Attackers who gain access to sensitive information and remove it from the organization are said to be performing data exfiltration. Disclosure may also occur accidentally, such as when an administrator misconfigures access controls or an employee loses a device.",
      "Alteration is the unauthorized modification of information and is a violation of the principle of integrity. Attackers may seek to modify records contained in a system for financial gain, such as adding fraudulent transactions to a financial account. Alteration may occur as the result of natural activity, such as a power surge causing a “bit flip” that modifies stored data. Accidental alteration is also a possibility, if users unintentionally modify information stored in a critical system as the result of a typo or other unintended activity.",
      "Denial is the disruption of an authorized user's legitimate access to information. Denial events violate the principle of availability. This availability loss may be intentional, such as when an attacker launches a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against a website. Denial may also occur as the result of accidental activity, such as the failure of a critical server, or as the result of natural activity, such as a natural disaster impacting a communications circuit.",
      "The CIA and DAD triads are very useful tools for cybersecurity planning and risk analysis. Whenever you find yourself tasked with a broad goal of assessing the security controls used to protect an asset or the threats to an organization, you can turn to the CIA and DAD triads for guidance. For example, if you're asked to assess the threats to your organization's website, you may apply the DAD triad in your analysis:",
      "Does the website contain sensitive information that would damage the organization if disclosed to unauthorized individuals?",
      "If an attacker were able to modify information contained on the website, would this unauthorized alteration cause financial, reputational, or operational damage to the organization?",
      "Does the website perform mission-critical activities that could damage the business significantly if an attacker were able to disrupt the site?",
      "That's just one example of using the DAD triad to inform a risk assessment. You can use the CIA and DAD models in almost any situation to serve as a helpful starting point for a more detailed risk analysis."

However, the organization may also suffer financial damage. Some of this financial damage may come in the form of lost business due to the reputational damage.

Examples of administrative managerial controls include periodic risk assessments, security planning exercises, and the incorporation of security into the organization's change management, service acquisition, and project management practices.",

      "If you're not familiar with some of the controls provided as examples in this chapter, don't worry about it! We'll discuss them all in detail later in the book.",
      "Organizations should select a set of security controls that meets their control objectives based on the criteria and parameters that they either select for their environment or have imposed on them by outside regulators. For example, an organization that handles sensitive information might decide that confidentiality concerns surrounding that information require the highest level of control. At the same time, they might conclude that the availability of their website is not of critical importance. Given these considerations, they would dedicate significant resources to the confidentiality of sensitive information while perhaps investing little, if any, time and money protecting their website against a denial-of-service attack.",

      "For example, an organization might find that it needs to run an outdated version of an operating system on a specific machine because software necessary to run the business will only function on that operating system version. Most security policies would prohibit using the outdated operating system because it might be susceptible to security vulnerabilities. The organization could choose to run this system on an isolated network with either very little or no access to other systems as a compensating control.",
      "The general idea is that a compensating control finds alternative means to achieve an objective when the organization cannot meet the original control requirement. Although PCI DSS offers a very formal process for compensating controls, the use of compensating controls is a common strategy in many different organizations, even those not subject to PCI DSS. Compensating controls balance the fact that it simply isn't possible to implement every required security control in every circumstance with the desire to manage risk to the greatest feasible degree.",
      "In many cases, organizations adopt compensating controls to address a temporary exception to a security requirement. In those cases, the organization should also develop remediation plans designed to bring the organization back into compliance with the literal meaning and intent of the original control."

      "Data loss prevention (DLP) systems help organizations enforce information handling policies and procedures to prevent data loss and theft. They search systems for stores of sensitive information that might be unsecured and monitor network traffic for potential attempts to remove sensitive information from the organization. They can act quickly to block the transmission before damage is done and alert administrators to the attempted breach.",
      "DLP systems work in two different environments:",
      "Agent-based DLP uses software agents installed on systems that search those systems for the presence of sensitive information. These searches often turn up Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, and other sensitive information in the most unlikely places!",
      "Detecting the presence of stored sensitive information allows security professionals to take prompt action to either remove it or secure it with encryption. Taking the time to secure or remove information now may pay handsome rewards down the road if the device is lost, stolen, or compromised.",
      "Agent-based DLP can also monitor system configuration and user actions, blocking undesirable actions. For example, some organizations use host-based DLP to block users from accessing USB-based removable media devices that they might use to carry information out of the organization's secure environment.",
      "Agentless (network-based) DLP systems are dedicated devices that sit on the network and monitor outbound network traffic, watching for any transmissions that contain unencrypted sensitive information. They can then block those transmissions, preventing the unsecured loss of sensitive information.",
      "DLP systems may simply block traffic that violates the organization's policy, or in some cases, they may automatically apply encryption to the content. This automatic encryption is commonly used with DLP systems that focus on email.",
      "DLP systems also have two mechanisms of action:",
      "Pattern matching, where they watch for the telltale signs of sensitive information. For example, if they see a number that is formatted like a credit card or Social Security number, they can automatically trigger on that. Similarly, they may contain a database of sensitive terms, such as “Top Secret” or “Business Confidential,” and trigger when they see those terms in an outbound transmission.",
      "Watermarking, where systems or administrators apply electronic tags to sensitive documents and then the DLP system can monitor systems and networks for unencrypted content containing those tags.",

    "paragraphs": [
      "Data minimization techniques seek to reduce risk by reducing the amount of sensitive information that we maintain on a regular basis. The best way to achieve data minimization is to simply destroy data when it is no longer necessary to meet our original business purpose.",
      "If we can't completely remove data from a dataset, we can often transform it into a format where the original sensitive information is deidentified. The deidentification process removes the ability to link data back to an individual, reducing its sensitivity.",
      "An alternative to deidentifying data is transforming it into a format where the original information can't be retrieved. This is a process called data obfuscation, and we have several tools at our disposal to assist with it:",
      "Hashing uses a hash function to transform a value in our dataset to a corresponding hash value. If we apply a strong hash function to a data element, we may replace the value in our file with the hashed value.",
      "Tokenization replaces sensitive values with a unique identifier using a lookup table. For example, we might replace a widely known value, such as a student ID, with a randomly generated 10-digit number. We'd then maintain a lookup table that allows us to convert those back to student IDs if we need to determine someone's identity. Of course, if you use this approach, you need to keep the lookup table secure!",
      "Masking partially redacts sensitive information by replacing some or all sensitive fields with blank characters. For example, we might replace all but the last four digits of a credit card number with X's or *'s to render the card number unreadable.",
      "Although it isn't possible to retrieve the original value directly from the hashed value, there is one major flaw to this approach. If someone has a list of possible values for a field, they can conduct something called a rainbow table attack. In this attack, the attacker computes the hashes of those candidate values and then checks to see if those hashes exist in our data file.",
      "For example, imagine that we have a file listing all the students at our college who have failed courses but we hash their student IDs. If an attacker has a list of all students, they can compute the hash values of all student IDs and then check to see which hash values are on the list. For this reason, hashing should only be used with caution."

Controls are grouped into the categories of managerial, operational, physical, and technical based on the way that they achieve their objectives. They are divided into the types of preventive, detective, corrective, deterrent, compensating, and directive based on their intended purpose.",
      "Data breaches have significant and diverse impacts on organizations. When an organization suffers a data breach, the resulting data loss often results in both direct and indirect damages. The organization suffers immediate financial repercussions due to the costs associated with the incident response, as well as long-term financial consequences due to reputational damage. This reputational damage may be difficult to quantify, but it also may have a lasting impact. In some cases, organizations may suffer operational damage if they experience availability damages, preventing them from accessing their own information.",
      "Data must be protected in transit, at rest, and in use. Attackers may attempt to eavesdrop on network transmissions containing sensitive information. This information is highly vulnerable when in transit unless protected by encryption technology. Attackers also might attempt to breach data stores, stealing data at rest. Encryption serves to protect stored data as well as data in transit. Data is also vulnerable while in use on a system and should be protected during data processing activities.",

Often such attackers may rely almost entirely on automated tools they download from the Internet. These attackers often have little knowledge of how their attacks actually work, and they are simply seeking out convenient targets of opportunity.",
      "You might think that with their relatively low skill level, unskilled attackers are not a real security threat. However, that isn't the case for two important reasons. First, simplistic hacking tools are freely available on the Internet. If you're vulnerable to them, anyone can easily find tools to automate denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, create viruses, make a Trojan horse, or even distribute ransomware as a service. Personal technical skills are no longer a barrier to attacking a network.",
      "Second, unskilled attackers are plentiful and unfocused in their work. Although the nature of your business might not find you in the crosshairs of a sophisticated military-sponsored attack, unskilled attackers are much less discriminating in their target selection. They often just search for and discover vulnerable victims without even knowing the identity of their target. They might root around in files and systems and only discover who they've penetrated after their attack succeeds.",
      "In general, the motivations of unskilled attackers revolve around trying to prove their skill. In other words, they may attack your network simply because it is there. Secondary school and university networks are common targets of unskilled attackers attacks because many of these attackers are school-aged individuals.",

These individuals tend to be rather young, they work alone, and they have very few resources. And by resources, we mean time as well as money.

Or a hacktivist might attack a network due to some political issue. The defining characteristic of hacktivists is that they believe they are motivated by the greater good, even if their activity violates the law.",

Because they believe that they are engaged in a just crusade, they will, at least in some instances, risk getting caught to accomplish their goals. They may even view being caught as a badge of honor and a sacrifice for their cause.",

In fact, some cybersecurity researchers believe that some hacktivists are actually employed as cybersecurity professionals as their “day job” and perform hacktivist attacks in their spare time. Highly skilled hacktivists pose a significant danger to their targets.",

The hacking group Anonymous, who uses the logo seen in Figure 2.1, is the most well-known hacktivist group. They collectively decide their agenda and their targets. Over the years, Anonymous has waged cyberattacks against targets as diverse as the Church of Scientology, PayPal, Visa and Mastercard, Westboro Baptist Church, and even government agencies.",
      "This type of anonymous collective of attackers can prove quite powerful. Large groups will always have more time and other resources than a lone attacker. Due to their distributed and anonymous nature, it is difficult to identify, investigate, and prosecute participants in their hacking activities. The group lacks a hierarchical structure, and the capture of one member is unlikely to compromise the identities of other members.",

In those instances, it is more likely that the hacktivist will attack the company by releasing confidential information. Government employees and self-styled whistleblowers fit this pattern of activity, seeking to bring what they consider unethical government actions to the attention of the public.",
      "For example, many people consider Edward Snowden a hacktivist. In 2013, Snowden, a former contractor with the U.S. National Security Agency, shared a large cache of sensitive government documents with journalists.

      "Organized crime appears in any case where there is money to be made, and cybercrime is no exception. The ranks of cybercriminals include links to traditional organized crime families in the United States, outlaw gangs, the Russian mafia, and even criminal groups organized specifically for the purpose of engaging in cybercrime.",
      "The common thread among these groups is motive and intent. The motive is simply illegal financial gain. Organized criminal syndicates do not normally embrace political issues or causes, and they are not trying to demonstrate their skills. In fact, they would often prefer to remain in the shadows, drawing as little attention to themselves as possible. They simply want to generate as much illegal profit as they possibly can.",
      "In their 2021 Internet Organized Crime Threat Assessment (IOCTA), the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (EUROPOL) found that organized crime groups were active in a variety of cybercrime categories, including the following:",
      "Cyber-dependent crime, including ransomware, data compromise, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, website defacement, and attacks against critical infrastructure",
      "Child sexual abuse material, including child pornography, abuse, and solicitation",
      "Online fraud, including credit card fraud and business email compromises",
      "Dark web activity, including the sale of illegal goods and services",
      "Cross-cutting crime factors, including social engineering, money mules, and the criminal abuse of cryptocurrencies",
      "Organized crime tends to have attackers who range from moderately skilled to highly skilled. It is rare for unskilled attackers to be involved in these crimes, and if they are, they tend to be caught rather quickly. The other defining factor is that organized crime groups tend to have more resources, both in terms of time and money, than do hacktivists or unskilled attackers. They often embrace the idea that “it takes money to make money” and are willing to invest in their criminal enterprises in the hopes of yielding a significant return on their investments."

They did not do this with any malicious intent. On the contrary, they were trying to benefit the business by being more productive.",

Shadow IT poses a risk to the organization because it puts sensitive information in the hands of vendors outside of the organization's control.

      "Commercial closed-source intelligence is often part of a service offering, which can be a compelling resource for security professionals. The sheer amount of data available via open source threat intelligence feeds can be overwhelming for many organizations. Combing through threat feeds to identify relevant threats, and then ensuring that they are both well defined and applied appropriately for your organization, can require massive amounts of effort. Validating threat data can be difficult in many cases, and once you are done making sure you have quality threat data, you still have to do something with it!"

      "The authors of this book learned a lesson about up-to-date threat feeds a number of years ago after working with an IDS and IPS vendor. The vendor promised up-to-date feeds and signatures for current issues, but they tended to run behind other vendors in the marketplace. In one case, a critical Microsoft vulnerability was announced, and exploit code was available and in active use within less than 48 hours. Despite repeated queries, the vendor did not provide detection rules for over two weeks. Unfortunately, manual creation of rules on this vendor's platform did not work well, resulting in exposure of systems that should have been protected.",
      "It is critical that you have reliable, up-to-date feeds to avoid situations like this. You may want to have multiple feeds that you can check against each other—often one feed may be faster or release information sooner, so multiple good-quality, reliable feeds can be a big help!",

      "Organizations may also use threat mapping information to gain insight into the sources of attacks aimed directly at their networks. However, threat map information viewed skeptically because geographic attribution is notoriously unreliable. Attackers often relay their attacks through cloud services and other compromised networks, hiding their true geographic location from threat analysis tools.",

Confidence scores allow organizations to filter and use threat intelligence based on how much trust they can give it. That doesn't mean that lower confidence information isn't useful; in fact, a lot of threat intelligence starts with a lower confidence score, and that score increases as the information solidifies and as additional sources of information confirm it or are able to do a full analysis.

The worm was aimed at the Iranian nuclear program, and copied itself to thumb drives to bypass air-gapped (physically separated systems without a network connection) computers. Stuxnet took advantage of a number of advanced techniques for its time, including using a trusted digital certificate, searching for specific industrial control systems (ICSs) that were known to be used by the Iranian nuclear program, and specific programming to attack and damage centrifuges while providing false monitoring data to controllers to ensure that the damage would not be noticed until it was too late.",

Firewalls, IPS devices, network segmentation, and similar controls are the first layer of defense. Patching and configuring services to limit attack surfaces is also a best practice for preventing worms. After an infection responses may include use of antimalware, EDR, and similar tools to stop and potentially remove infections. Depending on the complexity of the malware, removal may be nearly impossible, and as with many types of malware reinstallation or resetting to original firmware may be required for some devices."

Many spyware packages track users' browsing habits, installed software, or similar information and report it back to central servers. Some spyware is relatively innocuous, but malicious spyware exists that targets sensitive data, allows remote access to web cameras, or otherwise provides illicit or undesirable access to the systems it is installed on. Spyware is associated with identity theft and fraud, advertising and redirection of traffic, digital rights management (DRM) monitoring, and with stalkerware, a type of spyware used to illicitly monitor partners in relationships.",
      "Spyware is most frequently combated using antimalware tools, although user awareness can help prevent the installation of spyware that is included in installers for software (thus acting as a form of Trojan), or through other means where spyware may appear to be a useful tool or innocuous utility.",

Thus, spyware may use Trojan, worm, or virus-style propagation methods in some cases, but the intent is to gather information about a user or system, with the methods used being less important than the goal.",
      "Mitigation practices for spyware focus on awareness, control of the software that is allowed on devices and systems, and antispyware capabilities built into antimalware tools. Since spyware is generally perceived as less of a threat than many types of malware, it is commonly categorized separately and may require specific configuration to identify and remove it.",

Viruses require one or more infection mechanisms that they use to spread themselves, like copying to a thumb drive or network share, and that mechanism is typically paired with some form of search capability to find new places to spread to once they are run. Viruses also typically have both a trigger, which sets the conditions for when the virus will execute, and a payload, which is what the virus does, delivers, or the actions it performs. Viruses come in many varieties, including:",

      "Fileless virus attacks are similar to traditional viruses in a number of critical ways. They spread via methods like spam email and malicious websites and exploit flaws in browser plug-ins and web browsers themselves. Once they successfully find a way into a system, they inject themselves into memory and conduct further malicious activity, including adding the ability to reinfect the system via the same process at reboot through a Registry entry or other technique. At no point do they require local file storage, as they remain memory resident throughout their entire active life—in fact, the only stored artifact of many fileless attacks would be the artifacts of their persistence techniques like the Registry entry shown in Figure 3.2.",
      "FIGURE 3.2 Fileless virus attack chain",
      "As you might expect from the infection flow diagram in Figure 3.2, fileless attacks require a vulnerability to succeed, so ensuring that browsers, plug-ins, and other software that might be exploited by attackers are up to date and protected can prevent most attacks. Using antimalware tools that can detect unexpected behavior from scripting tools like Microsoft PowerShell can also help stop fileless viruses. Finally, network level defenses like intrusion prevention systems (IPSs), as well as reputation-based protection systems can prevent potentially vulnerable systems from browsing known malicious sites.",

      "Rootkit detection can be challenging, because a system infected with malware like this cannot be trusted. That means that the best way to detect a rootkit is to test the suspected system from a trusted system or device. In cases where that isn't possible, rootkit detection tools look for behaviors and signatures that are typical of rootkits. Techniques like integrity checking and data validation against expected responses can also be useful for rootkit detection, and anti-rootkit tools often use a combination of these techniques to detect complex rootkits.",
      "Once a rootkit is discovered, removal can be challenging. While some antimalware and anti-rootkit tools are able to remove specific rootkits, the most common recommendation whenever possible is to rebuild the system or to restore it from a known good backup. As virtual machines, containers, system imaging, and software-defined environments have become more common, this has simplified restoration processes, and in many cases may be as fast, or faster than ensuring that a system infected with a rootkit has been properly and fully cleaned.",

      "Authority, which relies on the fact that most people will obey someone who appears to be in charge or knowledgeable, regardless of whether or not they actually are. A social engineer using the principle of authority may claim to be a manager, a government official, or some other person who would have authority in the situation they are operating in.",
      "Intimidation relies on scaring or bullying an individual into taking a desired action. The individual who is targeted will feel threatened and respond by doing what the social engineer wants them to do.",
      "Consensus-based social engineering uses the fact that people tend to want to do what others are doing to persuade them to take an action. A consensus-based social engineering attack might point out that everyone else in a department had already clicked on a link, or might provide fake testimonials about a product making it look safe. Consensus is called “social proof” in some categorization schemes.",
      "Scarcity is used for social engineering in scenarios that make something look more desirable because it may be the last one available.",
      "Familiarity-based attacks rely on you liking the individual or even the organization the individual is claiming to represent.",
      "Trust, much like familiarity, relies on a connection with the individual they are targeting. Unlike with familiarity, which relies on targets thinking that something is normal and thus familiar, social engineers who use this technique work to build a connection with their targets so that they will take the actions that they want them to take.",
      "Urgency relies on creating a feeling that the action must be taken quickly due to some reason or reasons.",
      "You may have noticed that each of these social engineering principles works because it causes the target to react to a situation and that many make the target nervous or worried about a result or scenario. Social engineering relies on human reactions, and we are most vulnerable when we are responding instead of thinking clearly.",
      "Many, if not most, social engineering efforts in the real world combine multiple principles into a single attack. If a penetration tester calls, claiming to be a senior leader's assistant in another part of your company (thus leading authority and possibly familiarity responses), and then insists that that senior leader has an urgent need (urgency) and informs their target that they could lose their job if they don't do something immediately (intimidation), they are more likely to be successful in many cases than if they only used one principle. A key part of social engineering is understanding the target, how humans react, and how stress reactions can be leveraged to meet a goal."

Regardless of how elegant or well thought out their input is, in the end, brute force is simply a process that involves trying different variations until it succeeds.",

Dictionary attacks and the use of rainbow tables remain common as well, and help provide context for password attacks in general. We've included them here so you'll have the full picture—they just shouldn't show up on the exam.",
      "Regardless of the password attack mechanism, an important differentiator between attack methods is whether they occur online, and thus against a live system that may have defenses in place, or if they are offline against a compromised or captured password store. If you can capture hashed passwords from a password store, tools like rainbow tables can be very useful and will typically be far faster than brute-force attacks. Rainbow tables are an easily searchable database of precomputed hashes using the same hashing methodology as the captured password file. Thus, if you captured a set of passwords that were hashed using MD5 you could use a pre-computed hash rainbow table to allow you to simply look up the hashed passwords.",
      "If you're not familiar with the concept of hashing, now is a good time to review it. A hash is a one-way cryptographic function that takes an input and generates a unique and repeatable output from that input. No two inputs should ever generate the same hash, and a hash should not be reversible so that the original input can be derived from the hash. Of course hash collisions do occur, which leads to new hashing algorithms being designed and used. Rainbow tables don't allow you to break hashes, but they brute-force the solution by using computational power to create a database where hashes and the value that created them can be looked up. You still aren't reversing the hash, but you are able to figure out what plain text leads to that hash being created!",
      "If you have captured a password file, you can also use a password cracker against it. Password crackers like John the Ripper, shown in Figure 4.2, attempt to crack passwords by trying brute-force and dictionary attacks against a variety of common password storage formats.",
      "Learning how to use tools like John the Ripper can help you understand both password cracking and how passwords are stored. You can find a variety of exercises at https://openwall.info/wiki/john/tutorials that will get you started.",
      "Password cracking tools like John the Ripper can also be used as password assessment tools. Some organizations continue to periodically test for weak and easily cracked passwords by using a password cracker on their password stores. In many cases, use of MFA paired with password complexity requirements have largely replaced this assessment process, and that trend is likely to continue.",
      "Of course, not every system is well maintained, and a penetration tester or attacker's favorite opportunity is finding plain-text or unencrypted passwords to acquire. Without some form of protection, passwords that are just maintained in a list can be easily acquired and reused by even the most casual of attackers. As noted earlier, using a strong password hashing mechanism, as well as techniques like using a salt and a pepper (additional data added to passwords before they are hashed, making it harder to use tools like rainbow tables) can help protect passwords. In fact, best practices for password storage don't rely on encryption; they rely on passwords never being stored and instead using a well-constructed password hash to verify passwords at login.",

      "Once an organization decides that it wishes to conduct vulnerability scanning and determines which, if any, regulatory requirements apply to their scans, they move on to the more detailed phases of the planning process. The next step is to identify the systems that will be covered by the vulnerability scans. Some organizations choose to cover all systems in their scanning process, whereas others scan systems differently (or not at all) depending on the answers to many different questions, including:",

Figure 5.1 shows an example of an asset map developed using the Qualys vulnerability scanner's asset inventory functionality.",

These settings determine the types of checks that the scanner will perform and should be customized to ensure that the scan meets its objectives while minimizing the possibility of disrupting the target environment.",
      "Typically, administrators create a new scan by beginning with a template. This may be a template provided by the vulnerability management vendor and built into the product, such as the Nessus scan templates shown in Figure 5.4, or it may be a custom-developed template created for use within the organization. As administrators create their own scan configurations, they should consider saving common configuration settings in templates to allow efficient reuse of their work, saving time and reducing errors when configuring future scans.",
      "FIGURE 5.4 Nessus scan templates",
      "Administrators may also improve the efficiency of their scans by configuring the specific plug-ins that will run during each scan. Each plug-in performs a check for a specific vulnerability, and these plug-ins are often grouped into families based on the operating system, application, or device that they involve. Disabling unnecessary plug-ins improves the speed of the scan by bypassing unnecessary checks and also may reduce the number of false positive results detected by the scanner.",

Administrators want to run these scans because they may identify problems that could be exploited by a malicious source. At the same time, cybersecurity professionals clearly don't want to cause problems on the organization's network and, as a result, may limit their scans to nonintrusive plug-ins.",
      "One way around this problem is to maintain a test environment containing copies of the same systems running on the production network and running scans against those test systems first. If the scans detect problems in the test environment, administrators may correct the underlying causes on both test and production networks before running scans on the production network."

      "Basic vulnerability scans run over a network, probing a system from a distance. This provides a realistic view of the system's security by simulating what an attacker might see from another network vantage point. However, the firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and other security controls that exist on the path between the scanner and the target server may affect the scan results, providing an inaccurate view of the server's security independent of those controls.",
      "Additionally, many security vulnerabilities are difficult to confirm using only a remote scan. Vulnerability scans that run over the network may detect the possibility that a vulnerability exists but be unable to confirm it with confidence, causing a false positive result that requires time-consuming administrator investigation.",
      "Modern vulnerability management solutions can supplement these remote scans with trusted information about server configurations. This information may be gathered in two ways. First, administrators can provide the scanner with credentials that allow the scanner to connect to the target server and retrieve configuration information. This information can then be used to determine whether a vulnerability exists, improving the scan's accuracy over noncredentialed alternatives. For example, if a vulnerability scan detects a potential issue that can be corrected by an operating system update, the credentialed scan can check whether the update is installed on the system before reporting a vulnerability.",

      "In addition to credentialed scanning, some scanners supplement the traditional server-based scanning approach to vulnerability scanning with a complementary agent-based scanning approach. In this approach, administrators install small software agents on each target server. These agents conduct scans of the server configuration, providing an “inside-out” vulnerability scan, and then report information back to the vulnerability management platform for analysis and reporting.",
      "System administrators are typically wary of installing agents on the servers that they manage for fear that the agent will cause performance or stability issues. If you choose to use an agent-based approach to scanning, you should approach this concept conservatively, beginning with a small pilot deployment that builds confidence in the agent before proceeding with a more widespread deployment."

      "In Chapter 1, “Today's Security Professional,” you learned about the CIA triad and how the goals of confidentiality, integrity, and availability are central to the field of cybersecurity. Cybersecurity defenders do spend the majority of their time thinking in these terms, designing controls and defenses to protect information and systems against a wide array of known and unknown threats to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",
      "Penetration testers must take a very different approach in their thinking. Instead of trying to defend against all possible threats, they only need to find a single vulnerability that they might exploit to achieve their goals. To find these flaws, they must think like the adversary who might attack the system in the real world. This approach is commonly known as adopting the hacker mindset.",
      "Before we explore the hacker mindset in terms of technical systems, let's explore it using an example from the physical world. If you were responsible for the physical security of an electronics store, you might consider a variety of threats and implement controls designed to counter those threats. You'd be worried about shoplifting, robbery, and employee embezzlement, among other threats, and you might build a system of security controls that seeks to prevent those threats from materializing. These controls might include the following:",
      "Security cameras in high-risk areas",
      "Auditing of cash register receipts",
      "Theft detectors at the main entrance/exit to the store",
      "Exit alarms on emergency exits",
      "Burglar alarm wired to detect the opening of doors outside business hours",
      "Now, imagine that you've been engaged to conduct a security assessment of this store. You'd likely examine each one of these security controls and assess its ability to prevent each of the threats identified in your initial risk assessment. You'd also look for gaps in the existing security controls that might require supplementation. Your mandate is broad and high-level.",
      "Penetration tests, on the other hand, have a much more focused mandate. Instead of adopting the approach of a security professional, you adopt the mindset of an attacker. You don't need to evaluate the effectiveness of each one of these security controls. You simply need to find either one flaw in the existing controls or one scenario that was overlooked in planning those controls.",
      "In this example, a penetration tester might enter the store during business hours and conduct reconnaissance, gathering information about the security controls that are in place and the locations of critical merchandise. They might notice that, though the burglar alarm is tied to the doors, it does not include any sensors on the windows. The tester might then return in the middle of the night, smash a window, and grab valuable merchandise. Recognizing that the store has security cameras in place, the attacker might wear a mask and park a vehicle outside of the range of the cameras. That's the hacker mindset. You need to think like a criminal.",
      "There's an important corollary to the hacker mindset that is important for both attackers and defenders to keep in mind. When conducting a penetration test (or a real-world attack), the attacker needs to win only once. They might attempt hundreds or thousands of potential attacks against a target. The fact that an organization's security defenses block 99.99 percent of those attacks is irrelevant if one of the attacks succeeds. Cybersecurity professionals need to win every time; attackers need to win only once."

There's more than enough work to completely fill our days twice over. Why on earth would we want to take on the additional burden of performing penetration tests? After all, they are time-consuming to perform internally and expensive to outsource.",
      "The answer to this question is that penetration testing provides us with visibility into the organization's security posture that simply isn't available by other means. Penetration testing does not seek to replace all the other cybersecurity activities of the organization. Instead, it complements and builds on those efforts. Penetration testers bring their unique skills and perspectives to the table and can take the output of security tools and place them within the attacker's mindset, asking the question, “If I were an attacker, how could I use this information to my advantage?”"

Before we dive into that exploration, let's take a moment to consider why we conduct penetration testing. What benefits does it bring to the organization?",
      "First and foremost, penetration testing provides us with knowledge that we can't obtain elsewhere. By conducting thorough penetration tests, we learn whether an attacker with the same knowledge, skills, and information as our testers would likely be able to penetrate our defenses. If they can't gain a foothold, we can then be reasonably confident that our networks are secure against attack by an equivalently talented attacker under the present circumstances.",
      "Second, in the event that attackers are successful, penetration testing provides us with an important blueprint for remediation. Cybersecurity professionals can trace the actions of the testers as they progressed through the different stages of the attack and close the series of open doors that the testers passed through. This provides us with a more robust defense against future attacks.",
      "Finally, penetration tests can provide us with essential, focused information on specific attack targets. We might conduct a penetration test prior to the deployment of a new system that is specifically focused on exercising the security features of that new environment. Unlike the broad nature of an open-ended penetration test, these focused tests can drill into the defenses around a specific target and provide actionable insight that can prevent a vulnerability from initial exposure."

As with penetration testing, cybersecurity professionals engaged in threat hunting seek to adopt the attacker's mindset and imagine how hackers might seek to defeat an organization's security controls. The two disciplines diverge in what they accomplish with this information.",
      "Although penetration testers seek to evaluate the organization's security controls by testing them in the same manner as an attacker might, threat hunters use the attacker mindset to search the organization's technology infrastructure for the artifacts of a successful attack. They ask themselves what a hacker might do and what type of evidence they might leave behind and then go in search of that evidence.",
      "Threat hunting builds on a cybersecurity philosophy known as the “presumption of compromise.” This approach assumes that attackers have already successfully breached an organization and searches out the evidence of successful attacks. When threat hunters discover a potential compromise, they then kick into incident handling mode, seeking to contain, eradicate, and recover from the compromise. They also conduct a postmortem analysis of the factors that contributed to the compromise in an effort to remediate deficiencies. This post-event remediation is another similarity between penetration testing and threat hunting: organizations leverage the output of both processes in similar ways.",
      "Threat hunters work with a variety of intelligence sources, using the concept of intelligence fusion to combine information from threat feeds, security advisories and bulletins, and other sources. They then seek to trace the path that an attacker followed as they maneuver through a target network."

      "There are four major categories of penetration testing:",
      "Physical penetration testing focuses on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in an organization's physical security controls. This can include breaking into buildings, bypassing access control systems, or compromising surveillance systems. The primary objective of physical penetration testing is to assess the effectiveness of an organization's physical security measures in preventing unauthorized access to their facilities, equipment, and sensitive information.",
      "Offensive penetration testing is a proactive approach where security professionals act as attackers to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in an organization's networks, systems, and applications. The goal of offensive penetration testing is to simulate real-world cyberattacks and determine how well an organization can detect, respond to, and recover from these attacks.",
      "Defensive penetration testing focuses on evaluating an organization's ability to defend against cyberattacks. Unlike offensive penetration testing, which aims to exploit vulnerabilities, defensive penetration testing involves assessing the effectiveness of security policies, procedures, and technologies in detecting and mitigating threats.",
      "Integrated penetration testing combines aspects of both offensive and defensive testing to provide a comprehensive assessment of an organization's security posture. This approach involves close collaboration between offensive and defensive experts to identify vulnerabilities, simulate attacks, and evaluate the effectiveness of defensive measures.",
      "Once the type of assessment is known, one of the first things to decide about a penetration test is how much knowledge testers will have about the environment. Three typical classifications are used to describe this:",
      "Known environment tests are tests performed with full knowledge of the underlying technology, configurations, and settings that make up the target. Testers will typically have such information as network diagrams, lists of systems and IP network ranges, and even credentials to the systems they are testing. Known environment tests allow for effective testing of systems without requiring testers to spend time identifying targets and determining which may be a way in. This means that a known environment test is often more complete, since testers can get to every system, service, or other target that is in scope, and will have credentials and other materials that will allow them to be tested. Of course, since testers can see everything inside an environment, they may not provide an accurate view of what an external attacker would see, and controls that would have been effective against most attackers may be bypassed.",
      "Unknown environment tests are intended to replicate what an attacker would encounter. Testers are not provided with access to or information about an environment, and instead, they must gather information, discover vulnerabilities, and make their way through an infrastructure or systems like an attacker would. This approach can be time-consuming, but it can help provide a reasonably accurate assessment of how secure the target is against an attacker of similar or lesser skill. It is important to note that the quality and skillset of your penetration tester or team is very important when conducting an unknown environment penetration test—if the threat actor you expect to target your organization is more capable, a tester can't provide you with a realistic view of what they could do.",
      "Partially known environment tests are a blend of known and unknown environment testing. A partially known environment test may provide some information about the environment to the penetration testers without giving full access, credentials, or configuration details. A partially known environment test can help focus penetration testers’ time and effort while also providing a more accurate view of what an attacker would actually encounter."

Some assessments will intentionally be scheduled for noncritical timeframes to minimize the impact of potential service outages, whereas others may be scheduled during normal business hours to help test the organization's reaction to attacks.",
      "What locations, systems, applications, or other potential targets are included or excluded. This also often includes discussions about third-party service providers that may be impacted by the test, such as Internet services providers, software-as-a-service (SaaS) or other cloud service providers, or outsourced security monitoring services. Any special technical constraints should also be discussed in the RoE.",
      "Data handling requirements for information gathered during the penetration test. This is particularly important when engagements cover sensitive organizational data or systems. Requirements for handling often include confidentiality requirements for the findings, such as encrypting data during and after the test, and contractual requirements for disposing of the penetration test data and results after the engagement is over.",
      "What behaviors to expect from the target. Defensive behaviors like shunning, deny listing, or other active defenses may limit the value of a penetration test. If the test is meant to evaluate defenses, this may be useful. If the test is meant to test a complete infrastructure, shunning or blocking the penetration testing team's efforts can waste time and resources.",
      "What resources are committed to the test. In known environment and partially known environment testing scenarios, time commitments from the administrators, developers, and other experts on the targets of the test are not only useful, they can be necessary for an effective test.",
      "Legal concerns should also be addressed, including a review of the laws that cover the target organization, any remote locations, and any service providers who will be in scope.",
      "When and how communications will occur. Should the engagement include daily or weekly updates regardless of progress, or will the penetration testers simply report when they are done with their work? How should the testers respond if they discover evidence of a current compromise?"

In most cases, you should be sure to have appropriate documentation for that permission in the form of a signed agreement, a memo from senior management, or a similar “get out of jail free” card from a person or people in the target organization with the rights to give you permission.",
      "Why is it called a “get out of jail free” card? It's the document that you would produce if something went wrong. Permission from the appropriate party can help you stay out of trouble if something goes wrong!",
      "Scoping agreements and the rules of engagement must define more than just what will be tested. In fact, documenting the limitations of the test can be just as important as what will be included. The testing agreement or scope documentation should contain disclaimers explaining that the test is valid only at the point in time that it is conducted, and that the scope and methodology chosen can impact the comprehensiveness of the test. After all, a known-environment penetration test is far more likely to find issues buried layers deep in a design than an unknown-environment test of well-secured systems!",
      "Problem handling and resolution is another key element of the rules of engagement. Although penetration testers and clients always hope that the tests will run smoothly and won't cause any disruption, testing systems and services, particularly in production environments using actual attack and exploit tools, can cause outages and other problems. In those cases, having a clearly defined communication, notification, and escalation path on both sides of the engagement can help minimize downtime and other issues for the target organization. Penetration testers should carefully document their responsibilities and limitations of liability, and ensure that clients know what could go wrong and that both sides agree on how it should be handled. That way, both the known and unknown impacts of the test can be addressed appropriately."

Assessment and testing results are meant for internal use only and are designed to evaluate controls with an eye toward finding potential improvements. Audits, on the other hand, are formal examinations performed with the purpose of demonstrating the effectiveness of controls to a third party. The staff who design, implement, and monitor controls for an organization have an inherent conflict of interest when evaluating the effectiveness of those controls.",

Weak configuration settings that create vulnerabilities include open permissions, unsecured root accounts, errors, weak encryption settings, insecure protocol use, default settings, and open ports and services. When a scan detects a vulnerability that does not exist, the report is known as a false positive. When a scan does not detect a vulnerability that actually exists, the report is known as a false negative.",

Threat hunting efforts include the use of advisories, bulletins, and threat intelligence feeds in an intelligence fusion program. They search for signs that attackers gained initial access to a network and then conducted maneuver activities on that network.",
      "Vulnerability scans probe systems, applications, and devices for known security issues. Vulnerability scans leverage application, network, and web application testing to check for known issues. These scans may be conducted in a credentialed or noncredentialed fashion and may be intrusive or nonintrusive, depending on the organization's needs. Analysts reviewing scans should also review logs and configurations for additional context. Vulnerabilities are described consistently using the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) standard and are rated using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). CVE and CVSS are components of the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP).",
      "Penetration testing places security professionals in the role of attackers. Penetration tests may be conducted in a manner that provides the testers with full access to information before the test (known environment), no information at all (unknown environment), or somewhere in between those two extremes (partially known environment). Testers conduct tests within the rules of engagement and normally begin with reconnaissance efforts, including war driving, war flying, footprinting, and open source intelligence (OSINT). They use this information to gain initial access to a system. From there, they seek to conduct privilege escalation to increase their level of access and lateral movement/pivoting to expand their access to other systems. They seek to achieve persistence to allow continued access after the vulnerability they initially exploited is patched. At the conclusion of the test, they conduct cleanup activities to restore systems to normal working order and remove traces of their activity.",

Testers who discover vulnerabilities are provided with financial rewards for their participation. This approach is a good way to motivate hackers to work for good, rather than using discovered vulnerabilities against a target.",

They may be performed by internal audit teams or independent third-party auditors. At the conclusion of an audit, the audit team makes an attestation about the adequacy and effectiveness of the organization's security controls.",
      "Understand the stages of the vulnerability life cycle. The stages of the vulnerability life cycle are vulnerability identification, analysis, response and remediation, validation of remediation, and reporting. Vulnerability identification can come from scans, penetration tests, responsible disclosure or bug bounty programs, and audit results. Analysis involves confirming the vulnerability, prioritizing it using CVSS and CVE, and considering organization-specific factors. Responses include applying patches, isolating affected systems, implementing compensating controls, transferring risk through insurance, or formally accepting the risk. Validation ensures the vulnerability is no longer present, and reporting informs stakeholders about the findings, actions, trends, and recommendations for improvement."

A malicious individual could create a web page with a link titled “Check your account at First Bank” and encode form input in the link. When the user visits the link, the web page appears to be an authentic First Bank website (because it is!) with the proper address in the toolbar and a valid digital certificate. However, the website would then execute the script included in the input by the malicious user, which appears to be part of the valid web page.",

At the most basic level, applications should never allow a user to include the <SCRIPT> tag in a reflected input field. However, this doesn't solve the problem completely; there are many clever alternatives available to an industrious web application attacker. The best solution is to determine the type of input that the application will allow and then validate the input to ensure that it matches that pattern. For example, if an application has a text box that allows users to enter their age, it should accept only one to three digits as input. The application should reject any other input as invalid."

The most important of these is input validation. Applications that allow user input should perform validation of that input to reduce the likelihood that it contains an attack. Improper input handling practices can expose applications to injection attacks, cross-site scripting attacks, and other exploits.",
      "The most effective form of input validation uses allow listing, in which the developer describes the exact type of input that is expected from the user and then verifies that the input matches that specification before passing the input to other processes or servers. For example, if an input form prompts a user to enter their age, allow listing could verify that the user supplied an integer value within the range 0–125. The application would then reject any values outside that range."

Client-side validation is useful for providing users with feedback on their input, but it should never be relied on as a security control. It's easy for hackers and penetration testers to bypass browser-based input validation.",
      "It is often difficult to perform allow listing because of the nature of many fields that allow user input. For example, imagine a classified ad application that allows users to input the description of a product that they wish to list for sale. It would be difficult to write logical rules that describe all valid submissions to that field that would also prevent the insertion of malicious code. In this case, developers might use deny listing to control user input. With this approach, developers do not try to explicitly describe acceptable input but instead describe potentially malicious input that must be blocked. For example, developers might restrict the use of HTML tags or SQL commands in user input. When performing input validation, developers must be mindful of the types of legitimate input that may appear in a field. For example, completely disallowing the use of a single quote (') may be useful in protecting against SQL injection attacks, but it may also make it difficult to enter last names that include apostrophes, such as O'Brien."

Organizations use cryptography to ensure that data is not maliciously or unintentionally altered. When we get to the third goal, authentication, the goals of cryptography begin to differ from the CIA triad. Although authentication begins with the letter A, remember that the A in the CIA triad is “availability.” Authentication refers to uses of encryption to validate the identity of individuals.

The system involves simply shifting all letters a certain number of spaces in the alphabet. Supposedly, Julius Caesar used a shift of three to the right. This simply means that you turn the A's of a message into D's, the B's into E's, and so on. When you hit the end of the alphabet, you simply “wrap around” so that X's become A's, Y's become B's, and Z's become C's.",

The key space is the range of values that are valid for use as a key for a specific algorithm. A key space is defined by its key length. Key length is nothing more than the number of binary bits (0s and 1s) in the key. The key space is the range between the key that has all 0s and the key that has all 1s. Or to state it another way, the key space is the range of numbers from 0 to 2n, where n is the bit size of the key. So, a 128-bit key can have a value from 0 to 2128 (which is roughly 3.40282367 × 1038, a very big number!). It is absolutely critical to protect the security of secret keys.

The principle can be summed up as “The enemy knows the system.”",

The algorithm used to perform columnar transposition is well known—you just read the details of it in this book!

However, this same computing power is also in the hands of cryptanalysts attempting to defeat the algorithms you use. Therefore, it's essential that you outpace adversaries by using sufficiently long keys that will defeat contemporary cryptanalysis efforts. Additionally, if you want to improve the chance that your data will remain safe from cryptanalysis some time into the future, you must strive to use keys that will outpace the projected increase in cryptanalytic capability during the entire time period the data must be kept safe. For example, the advent of quantum computing may transform cryptography, rendering current cryptosystems insecure, as discussed later in this chapter.",

Modern cryptographic systems use at least a 128-bit key to protect data against prying eyes.

Any user who wants to verify the signature simply decrypts the message digest using Bob's public key and then verifies that the decrypted message digest is accurate.",

      "The addition of new users requires the generation of only one public-private key pair. This same key pair is used to communicate with all users of the asymmetric cryptosystem. This makes the algorithm extremely scalable.",
      "Users can be removed far more easily from asymmetric systems. Asymmetric cryptosystems provide a key revocation mechanism that allows a key to be canceled, effectively removing a user from the system.",
      "Key regeneration is required only when a user's private key is compromised. If a user leaves the community, the system administrator simply needs to invalidate that user's keys. No other keys are compromised and therefore key regeneration is not required for any other user.",
      "Asymmetric key encryption can provide integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation. If a user does not share their private key with other individuals, a message signed by that user can be shown to be accurate and from a specific source and cannot be later repudiated.",
      "Key exchange is a simple process. Users who want to participate in the system simply make their public key available to anyone with whom they want to communicate. There is no method by which the private key can be derived from the public key.",
      "No preexisting communication link needs to exist. Two individuals can begin communicating securely from the start of their communication session. Asymmetric cryptography does not require a preexisting relationship to provide a secure mechanism for data exchange.",
      "The major weakness of public key cryptography is its slow speed of operation. For this reason, many applications that require the secure transmission of large amounts of data use public key cryptography to establish a connection and then exchange a symmetric secret key. The remainder of the session then uses symmetric cryptography. Table 7.1 compares the symmetric and asymmetric cryptography systems. Close examination of this table reveals that a weakness in one system is matched by a strength in the other."

One party provides the other party with a sheet of paper or piece of storage media containing the secret key. In many hardware encryption devices, this key material comes in the form of an electronic device that resembles an actual key that is inserted into the encryption device. However, every offline key distribution method has its own inherent flaws. If keying material is sent through the mail, it might be intercepted. Telephones can be wiretapped. Papers containing keys might be lost or thrown in the trash inadvertently.",

You must take into account the rapid growth of computing power—Moore's law suggests that computing power doubles approximately every 2 years. If it takes current computers one year of processing time to break your code, it will take only 3 months if the attempt is made with contemporary technology about 4 years down the road. If you expect that your data will still be sensitive at that time, you should choose a much longer cryptographic key that will remain secure well into the future.",

The major disadvantage to certificate revocation lists is that they must be downloaded and cross-referenced periodically, introducing a period of latency between the time a certificate is revoked and the time end users are notified of the revocation.",
      "Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) This protocol eliminates the latency inherent in the use of certificate revocation lists by providing a means for real-time certificate verification. When a client receives a certificate, it sends an OCSP request to the CA's OCSP server. The server then responds with a status of good, revoked, or unknown. The browser uses this information to determine whether the certificate is valid.",
      "Certificate Stapling The primary issue with OCSP is that it places a significant burden on the OCSP servers operated by certificate authorities. These servers must process requests from every single visitor to a website or other user of a digital certificate, verifying that the certificate is valid and not revoked. Certificate stapling is an extension to the Online Certificate Status Protocol that relieves some of the burden placed upon certificate authorities by the original protocol. When a user visits a website and initiates a secure connection, the website sends its certificate to the end user, who would normally then be responsible for contacting an OCSP server to verify the certificate's validity. In certificate stapling, the web server contacts the OCSP server itself and receives a signed and timestamped response from the OCSP server, which it then attaches, or staples, to the digital certificate. Then, when a user requests a secure web connection, the web server sends the certificate with the stapled OCSP response to the user. The user's browser then verifies that the certificate is authentic and also validates that the stapled OCSP response is genuine and recent. Because the CA signed the OCSP response, the user knows that it is from the certificate authority, and the time stamp ensures the user that the CA recently validated the certificate. From there, communication may continue as normal.",
      "The time savings come when the next user visits the website. The web server can simply reuse the stapled certificate without recontacting the OCSP server. As long as the time stamp is recent enough, the user will accept the stapled certificate without needing to contact the CA's OCSP server again. It's common to have stapled certificates with a validity period of 24 hours. That reduces the burden on an OCSP server from handling one request per user over the course of a day, which could be millions of requests, to handling one request per certificate per day. That's a tremendous reduction."

If you don't have a formal policy that you must follow, select an appropriate interval based on the frequency with which you use your key. Continued reuse of a key creates more encrypted material that may be used in cryptographic attacks. You might want to change your key pair every few months, if practical.",

A code key might wind up in the wrong hands, giving insights into what the key consists of. Many systems have been broken into as a result of these types of accidents.",

Most messages have a preamble that informs the receiver who the message is for, who sent it, how many characters are in the message, the date and time it was sent, and other pertinent information. In this case, the preamble was sent in clear text, and this information was also encrypted and put into the message. As a result, the cryptanalysts gained a key insight into the message contents. They were given approximately 50 characters that were repeated in the message in code. This error caused a relatively secure system to be compromised.",
      "Another error is to use weak or deprecated algorithms. Over time, some algorithms are no longer considered appropriate. This may be due to some flaw found in the algorithm. It can also be due to increasing computing power. For example, in 1976 DES was considered very strong. But advances in computer power have made its key length too short. Although the algorithm is sound, the key size makes DES a poor choice for modern cryptography, and that algorithm has been deprecated."

Confidentiality is the use of encryption to protect sensitive information from prying eyes. Integrity is the use of cryptography to ensure that data is not maliciously or unintentionally altered. Authentication refers to uses of encryption to validate the identity of individuals. Non-repudiation ensures that individuals can prove to a third party that a message came from its purported sender.",
      "Explain the differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption uses the same shared secret key to encrypt and decrypt information. Users must have some mechanism to exchange these shared secret keys. The Diffie–Hellman algorithm provides one approach. Asymmetric encryption provides each user with a pair of keys: a public key, which is freely shared, and a private key, which is kept secret. Anything encrypted with one key from the pair may be decrypted with the other key from the same pair.",
      "Explain how digital signatures provide non-repudiation. Digital signatures provide non-repudiation by allowing a third party to verify the authenticity of a message. Senders create digital signatures by using a hash function to generate a message digest and then encrypting that digest with their own private key. Others may verify the digital signature by decrypting it with the sender's public key and comparing this decrypted message digest to one that they compute themselves using the hash function on the message.",

Users and organizations obtain digital certificates from certificate authorities (CAs), who demonstrate their trust in the certificate by applying their digital signature. Recipients of the digital certificate can rely on the public key it contains if they trust the issuing CA and verify the CA's digital signature.",

Figure 8.2 shows an example of a common 802.1X architecture design using EAP, RADIUS, and LDAP.",
      "Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is one of the most common authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) systems for network devices, wireless networks, and other services. RADIUS can operate via TCP or UDP and operates in a client-server model. RADIUS sends passwords that are obfuscated by a shared secret and MD5 hash, meaning that its password security is not very strong. RADIUS traffic between the RADIUS network access server and the RADIUS server is typically encrypted using IPSec tunnels or other protections to protect the traffic.",

The system then allows them to perform actions they are authorized to by policies or permission settings. Accounting tracks resource utilization like time, bandwidth, or CPU utilization.",
      "Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus (TACACS+) is a Cisco-designed extension to TACACS, the Terminal Access Controller Access Control System.

      "Kerberos is a protocol for authenticating service requests between trusted hosts across an untrusted network like the Internet. Kerberos is designed to operate on untrusted networks and uses authentication to shield its authentication traffic. Kerberos users are composed of three main elements: the primary, which is typically the username; the instance, which helps to differentiate similar primaries; and realms, which consist of groups of users. Realms are typically separated by trust boundaries and have distinct Kerberos key distribution centers (KDCs). Figure 8.3 demonstrates a basic Kerberos authentication flow.",
      "FIGURE 8.3 Kerberos authentication process",
      "When a client wants to use Kerberos to access a service, the client requests an authentication ticket, or ticket-granting ticket (TGT). An authentication server checks the client's credentials and responds with the TGT, which is encrypted using the secret key of the ticket-granting service (TGS). When the client wants to use a service, the client sends the TGT to the TGS (which is usually also the KDC) and includes the name of the resource it wants to use. The TGS sends back a valid session key for the service, and the client presents the key to the service to access it.",
      "As you can see, authentication systems and processes can be complex, with a focus on ensuring that account holders are properly authenticated and that they are then given access to the specific resources or privileges that they should have. In modern zero-trust environments where continuous authorization checks are normal, this places an even heavier load on identity and authorization infrastructure."

SSO systems provide significant advantages because they simplify user interactions with authentication and authorization systems, but they require a trade-off in the number of identity-based security boundaries that are in place. This means that many organizations end up implementing SSO for many systems but may require additional authentication steps or use of an additional privileged account for high-security environments.",

Each of those units includes a number of entries labeled with a common name (CN).

In those cases, additional security, tighter access controls, or even an entirely separate public directory service may be required.",

A common example of this is the “Log in with Google” functionality that many websites provide, but Google is not the only example of a major OpenID identity provider. Microsoft, Amazon, and many other organizations are OpenID identity providers (IdPs). Relying parties (RPs) redirect authentication requests to the IdP and then receive a response with an assertion that the user is who they claim to be due to successful authentication, and the user is logged in using the OpenID for that user.",

In those scenarios, OpenID Connect and SAML are both used for federated authentication, whereas OAuth is used to handle authorization of access to protected resources.",

An attacker can obtain a one-time password but cannot continue using it, and it means that brute-force attacks will be constantly attempting to identify a constantly changing target. Though it is possible that a brute-force attack could randomly match a one-time password during the time that it is valid, the likelihood of an attack like that succeeding is incredibly small, and common controls that prevent brute-force attacks will make that type of success essentially impossible.",

The first is time-based one-time passwords (TOTP), which use an algorithm to derive a one-time password using the current time as part of the code-generation process. Authentication applications like Google Authenticator use TOTP, as shown in Figure 8.8. The code is valid for a set period of time and then moves on to the next time-based code, meaning that even if a code is compromised it will be valid for only a relatively short period of time.",

HOTP uses a seed value that both the token or HOTP code-generation application and the validation server use, as well as a moving factor. For HOTP tokens that work when you press a button, the moving factor is a counter, which is also stored on the token and the server. HOTP password generators, like the PayPal token shown in Figure 8.9 rely on an event, such as pressing a button, to cause them to generate a code. Since the codes are iterative, they can be checked from the last known use of the token, with iterations forward until the current press is found.

TOTP passwords can be stolen by either tricking a user into providing them, gaining access to a device like a phone, where they are generated, or otherwise having near real-time access to them. This means that attackers must use a stolen TOTP password immediately. One-time passwords sent via SMS can be redirected using a cloned SIM, or if the phone is part of a VoIP network, by compromising the VoIP system or account and redirecting the SMS factor.",

Push notifications are messages sent to a user to inform them of an event, in this case an authentication attempt. If users respond to the phone call with the requested validation—typically by pushing a specific button on the keypad—the authentication can proceed. Phone calls suffer from a number of issues as an authentication factor, including lower speed, which can cause issues with login timeouts; the potential for hijacking of calls via a variety of means; and additional costs for the implementing organization due to phone call costs.",
      "Although one-time passwords that are dynamically generated as they are needed are more common, at times, there is a need for a one-time password that does not require a device or connectivity. In those cases, static codes remain a useful option. Static codes are also algorithmically generated like other one-time passwords but are pre-generated and often printed or stored in a secure location. This creates a new risk model, which is that the paper they are printed on could be stolen, or if they are stored electronically, the file they're stored in could be lost or accessed.

These occur when a biometric factor is presented and is accepted when it shouldn't be. These are compared using a measure called the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). The ROC compares the FRR against the FAR of a system, typically as a graph. For most systems, as you decrease the likelihood of false rejection, you will increase the rate of false acceptance, and determining where the accuracy of a system should be set to minimize false acceptance and prevent false rejection is an important element in the configuration of biometric systems."

      "In addition to measures like these, in the real world you have to assess the user acceptance of the biometric system. Retina scanners failed to take off because most people don't want to bend over and peer into a retina scanner. At the same time, early generations of fingerprint scanners had a tough time scanning many fingerprints, and even now people who have worn their fingerprints off through manual labor or due to chemical or other exposure can't use many fingerprint readers. That means that biometric systems must often be deployed with a backup method available for some percentage of the user population, even if they will consent to use the system.",
      "Thus, deploying biometrics isn't as easy of a solution as it may sound up front. That doesn't mean they're not useful; the broad usage of Apple's Face ID and Touch ID, as well as Android's wide adoption of fingerprint readers, show that a biometric factor can be implemented successfully for many users in a reasonable way.",

      "When an account is provisioned, it is created and resources, permissions, and other attributes are set for it. In many instances, provisioning an account may also involve identity proofing, which is the process of ensuring that the person who the account is being created for is the person who is claiming the account. Common examples include providing government-issued credentials to open bank accounts or to create an account for government-sponsored sites to pay taxes. Organizations often identity-proof using government IDs as well as personal information that is unlikely another individual would possess.",
      "Account creation and identity proofing are commonly done during employee onboarding. Onboarding processes related to account creation include adding employees to groups and ensuring they have the right permissions to accomplish their role, as well as providing appropriate training to the employee.",
      "Creating an account and ensuring the right individual gains access to it is important, but providing the account with appropriate rights and permissions is what allows the account to be useful. This permissions assignment and permission management is a critical task in organizations. The concept of least privilege is at the core of permission management, and organizations seek to ensure that roles are associated with privileges to make privilege management easier. Managing specific rights for every user in an organization is a complex and error-prone task even in relatively small organizations and is impossible at scale.",
      "A key concern for organizations that manage permissions for users, groups, and roles over time is permission creep. Permission creep occurs when users take on new roles or are granted new permissions based on tasks they are doing. Over time, this tends to result in users accruing a broader set of permissions that may not match their current role. A common associated issue is that managers and others may request roles based on an individual with requests often phrased as “Give the new staff member permission that match the person who they are replacing.” If permission creep has occurred, that means the new individual will have the same overly broad permissions.",
      "Long-term permission management is a critical part of identity and access management systems and processes, and permission management with a least privilege approach is a key security control.",
      "In addition to this discussion of privileges at the conceptual level, we'll talk more about filesystem permissions a bit later in this chapter. For now, keep in mind the implication of permission assignment and long-term maintenance of permissions as employees and roles change in an organization.",
      "When an account is terminated, a process known as deprovisioning occurs. This removes the account, permissions, and related data, files, or other artifacts as required by the organization's processes and procedures. Deprovisioning is an important step because it helps to ensure that dormant accounts are not available for attackers to compromise or co-opt. Limited deprovisioning tasks may also be associated with role changes where an account or group of accounts have rights and privileges removed when a change is made.",
      "It may be tempting to simply disable an account in case it is needed again in the future. While disabling accounts may be done in specific circumstances, completely removing accounts removes the opportunity for attacks that reenable them or that use improperly disabled or improperly reenabled accounts. Thus, deletion of accounts is typically a preferred process in the deprovisioning process."

This is intended to prevent users from having ongoing access when they don't need that access on an ongoing basis. Users will typically use a console to “check out” permissions, which are then removed when the task is completed or a set time period expires. This helps to prevent privilege creep but does add an additional step for use of privileges.",

Password vaults are also commonly used to ensure that passwords are available for emergencies and outages.",

The Security+ exam covers a number of common access control schemes, which we'll look at next.",
      "Mandatory access control (MAC) systems rely on the operating system to enforce control as set by a security policy administrator. In a MAC implementation, users do not have the ability to grant access to files or otherwise change the security policies that are set centrally. MAC implementations were once only found in government and military systems, but now they can be found in specific high-security systems like SELinux and in Windows as Mandatory Integrity Control (MIC). MAC implementations remain relatively rare overall compared to discretionary access control.",
      "Discretionary access control (DAC) is an access control scheme that many people are used to from their own home PCs. The most common type of discretionary access control assigns owners for objects like files and directories, and then allows the owner to delegate rights and permissions to those objects as they desire. Linux file permissions provide an easy example of this. The owner of a file (or directory) can set permissions that apply to the owner, the group, or the world, and they can choose to allow the file to be read, modified, or executed.",
      "Role-based access control (RBAC) systems rely on roles that are then matched with privileges that are assigned to those roles. This makes RBAC a popular option for enterprises that can quickly categorize employees with roles like “cashier” or “database administrator” and provide users with the appropriate access to systems and data based on those roles. RBAC systems boil down to three primary rules:",
      "Role assignment, which states that subjects can use only permissions that match a role they have been assigned.",
      "Role authorization, which states that the subject's active role must be authorized for the subject. This prevents subjects from taking on roles they shouldn't be able to.",
      "Permission authorization, which states that subjects can use only permissions that their active role is allowed to use.",
      "Together, these three rules describe how permissions can be applied in an RBAC system. With these three rules, role hierarchies can be built that allow specific permissions to be available at the right levels based on roles in any given environment.",
      "An important detail for RBAC systems is that many support multiple roles for subjects. That means that you may have an active role, as well as other roles you could use. A familiar example of this might be the ability to use the sudo command on a Linux system. Users have a role as themselves (a user role), and they can also assume a superuser (root) role. When the root, or superuser, role is active, they can perform actions that root is authorized to perform. When it is not, they cannot perform those actions or access objects that are restricted to access by the root role.",
      "Rule-based access control, also sometimes called RBAC (and sometimes RuBAC to help differentiate it from role-based access control) is applied using a set of rules, or access control lists (ACLs), that apply to various objects or resources. When an attempt is made to access an object, the rule is checked to see if the access is allowed. A common example of a rule-based access control is a firewall ruleset.",
      "Attribute-based access control (ABAC) relies on policies that are driven by attributes of the users. This allows for complex rulesets based on combinations of attributes that provide users with specific rights that match the attributes they have. Since attributes can be set in specific contexts, this also means that ABAC schemes can be very flexible. The downside of ABAC policies is that they can also be complex to manage well due to their flexibility.",
      "Attribute-based access control schemes are useful for application security, where they are often used for enterprise systems that have complex user roles and rights that vary depending on the way and role that users interact with a system. They're also used with databases and content management systems, microservices, and APIs for similar reasons.",

An example in Windows is where logon hours can be set via Active Directory, defining the hours that a user or group of users can be logged onto a system.

      "Identity and access management is a key element in organizational security. Authentication is the process of proving your claim to an identity by providing one or more factors that include something you know, something you have, something you are, or somewhere you are. Authorization provides authenticated users with the privileges and rights they need to accomplish their roles. User accounts range from guest and normal users to service accounts and privileged administrative accounts. Account policies shape details and requirements for each account, including when accounts should be locked out or disabled.",
      "There are a wide range of authentication methods and technologies deployed throughout organizations. In addition, technologies like RADIUS, LDAP, EAP and CHAP, OAuth, OpenID, and SAML are commonly used as part of single sign-on infrastructure. Single sign-on (SSO) allows users to log in once and use their identities throughout many systems, whereas federation uses identity providers to authenticate users, who can then use those identities at various service providers and relying party locations without having to have a distinct identity there. Interoperability between identity and authorization systems is enabled by standards and shared protocols, making federation possible. Attestation provides validation that a user or identity belongs to the user claiming it.",
      "Multifactor authentication has helped limit the problems with passwords such as password theft, reuse, and brute-force attacks. Biometric authentication, which uses physical traits such as your fingerprint, retina print, or facial recognition, have become commonplace, but knowing how often they will incorrectly allow the wrong person in or reject a legitimate user is critical. Both hardware- and software-based authentication tokens are commonly used, with hardware security keys becoming increasingly common. Password vaults (or safes) provide cryptographically secured storage to keep passwords secure, and enterprise deployments support multiple users and controlled access schemes.",
      "Password best practices have changed as multifactor authentication has become more common. While configurations still often allow settings for length, complexity, reuse, expiration, and age, NIST and other organizations have begun to focus on length as the primary control to avoid brute forcing. Passwordless authentication is becoming more common, replacing passwords with secure tokens or applications.",
      "Access control schemes like attribute-based access control, discretionary access control, mandatory access control, and role-based access control all provide ways to determine which subjects can perform actions on objects. Privileged access management ensures that administrative users are well managed. Just-in-time permissions and ephemeral accounts are two of the many techniques that PAM systems employ to enable better control of privileged accounts."

Identities use attributes to describe the user, with various attributes like job, title, or even personal traits stored as part of that user's identity.",

Passwords best practices include configuration common settings like password length, complexity, reuse, expiration, and age. Understanding what each setting helps with and why it might be configured to specific settings is an important task for security professionals. Password managers help to limit password reuse and to manage passwords for organizations when implemented with enterprise solutions. Multifactor authentication relies on additional factors beyond passwords, including biometrics and hardware- and software-based tokens like security keys and authenticator applications. Multifactor requires the use of distinct factors: potential factors include something you know, something you have, something you are, or somewhere you are.",

Cost, maintenance requirements, suitability to the risks that your organization faces, and other factors are considerations you must take into account when building cybersecurity resilience.",
      "One of the most common ways to build resilience is through redundancy—in other words, having more than one of a system, service, device, or other component. As you read through these solutions, bear in mind that designing for resilience requires thinking through the entire environment that a resilient system or service resides in. Power, environmental controls, hardware and software failures, network connectivity, and any other factors that can fail or be disrupted must be assessed. Single points of failure—places where the failure of a single device, connection, or other element could disrupt or stop the system from functioning—must be identified and either compensated for or documented in the design.",
      "After all your assessment work has been completed, a design is created that balances business needs, design requirements and options, and the cost to build and operate the environment. Designs often have compromises made in them to meet cost, complexity, staffing, or other limitations based on the overall risk and likelihood of occurrence for the risks that were identified in the assessment and design phases.",
      "Common elements in designs for redundancy include the following:",
      "Geographic dispersion of systems ensures that a single disaster, attack, or failure cannot disable or destroy them. For datacenters and other facilities, a common rule of thumb is to place datacenters at least 90 miles apart, preventing most common natural disasters from disabling both (or more!) datacenters. This also helps ensure that facilities will not be impacted by issues with the power grid, network connectivity, and other similar issues.",
      "Separation of servers and other devices in datacenters is also commonly used to avoid a single rack being a point of failure. Thus, systems may be placed in two or more racks in case of a single-point failure of a power distribution unit (PDU) or even something as simple as a leak that drips down into the rack. Although most disasters won't impact something 90 miles away, hurricanes are a major example of a type of disaster that can have very broad impacts on multiple locations along their paths. Designers who build facilities in hurricane-prone regions tend to plan for resilience by placing backup facilities outside those hurricane-prone regions, typically by moving them farther inland. They will also invest in hurricane-proofing their critical infrastructure.",
      "Use of multiple network paths (multipath) solutions ensures that a severed cable or failed device will not cause a loss of connectivity.",
      "Redundant network devices, including multiple routers, security devices like firewalls and intrusion prevention systems, or other security appliances, are also commonly implemented to prevent a single point of failure and as part of high availability designs. Here are examples of ways to implement this: Load balancing, which makes multiple systems or services appear to be a single resource, allowing both redundancy and increased ability to handle loads by distributing them to more than one system. Load balancers are also commonly used to allow system upgrades by redirecting traffic away from systems that will be upgraded and then returning that traffic after they are patched or upgraded.",
      "Clustering describes groups of computers connected together to perform the same task. A cluster of computers might provide the web front-end for an application or serve as worker nodes in a supercomputer. Clustering essentially makes multiple systems appear like a single, larger system and provides redundancy through scale.",
      "Protection of power, through the use of uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems that provide battery or other backup power options for short periods of time; generator systems that are used to provide power for longer outages; and design elements, such as dual-supply or multisupply hardware, ensures that a power supply failure won't disable a server. Managed power distribution units (PDUs) are also used to provide intelligent power management and remote control of power delivered inside server racks and other environments.",
      "Systems and storage redundancy helps ensure that failed disks, servers, or other devices do not cause an outage.",
      "Platform diversity, or diversity of technologies and vendors, is another way to build resilience into an infrastructure. Using different vendors, cryptographic solutions, platforms, and controls can make it more difficult for a single attack or failure to have system- or organization-wide impacts. There is a real cost to using different technologies, such as additional training, the potential for issues when integrating disparate systems, and the potential for human error that increases as complexity increases."

      "The use of redundant arrays of inexpensive disks (RAID) is a common solution that uses multiple disks with data either striped (spread across disks) or mirrored (completely duplicated), and technology to ensure that data is not corrupted or lost (parity). RAID ensures that an array can handle one or more disk failures without losing data. Table 9.1 shows the most common RAID solutions with their advantages and disadvantages.",
      "TABLE 9.1 RAID levels, advantages, and disadvantages",
      "In addition to disk-level protections, backups and replication are frequently used to ensure that data loss does not impact an organization. Backups are a copy of the live storage system: a full backup, which copies the entire device or storage system; an incremental backup, which captures the changes since the last backup and is faster to back up but slower to recover; or a differential backup, which captures the changes since the last full backup and is faster to recover but slower to back up. Running a full backup each time a backup is required requires far more space than an incremental backup, but incremental backups need to be layered with each set of changes applied to get back to a full backup if a complete restoration is required. Since most failures are not a complete storage failure and the cost of space for multiple full backups is much higher, most organizations choose to implement incremental backups, typically with a full backup on a periodic basis.",
      "Replication focuses on using either synchronous or asynchronous methods to copy live data to another location or device. Unlike backups that occur periodically in most designs, replication is always occurring as changes are made. Replication helps with multisite, multisystem designs, ensuring that changes are carried over to all systems or clusters that are part of an architecture. In synchronous replication designs, that occurs in real time, but a backup cluster may rely on asynchronous replication that occurs after the fact, but typically much more regularly than a backup. In either design, replication can help with disaster recovery, availability, and load balancing.",
      "Another data protection option is journaling, which creates a log of changes that can be reapplied if an issue occurs. Journaling is commonly used for databases and similar technologies that combine frequent changes with an ability to restore to a point in time. Journaling also has a role to play in virtual environments where journal-based solutions allow virtual machines to be restored to a point in time rather than to a fixed snapshot."

    "headingLevel": 3,
    "paragraphs": [
      "Journaling sounds great, so why not use it instead of all other sorts of backups? A journal still needs to be backed up somewhere else! If a journal is simply maintained on the source system, a single failure can cause data loss. Backing up a journal can help address that issue and can also help prevent malicious or inadvertent changes to the journal causing issues.",
      "Why not simply journal everything as a default option? Once again that may not be the best option depending on an organization's needs. Restoring journaled transactions can slow down recovery processes as the journal must be replayed and applied to the target dataset or system. Journaling isn't an ideal solution when time to recover may be an important consideration. Thus, like any resilience solution journaling should be one tool among many that is applied when it is appropriate and useful to do so.",
      "Backup frequency is another key design consideration. Some backups for frequently changing data may need to be continuous, such as for database transactions. Other backups may happen daily, weekly, or monthly depending on the data rate of change, the organization or function's ability to tolerate data loss if the production system was lost and backups had to be restored, and the cost of the selected backup frequency. Backup frequency also drives the amount of effort that will be required to restore data after an issue occurs. If there are constant incremental backups being made, a restoration process may require a full backup restoration, and then a series of incremental backups may need to be applied in order to get back to the point in time that the issue occurred.",
      "The ability to recover from backups as well as the organization's needs for that recovery process drive both design decisions and organizational processes. Organizations will create recovery point objectives (RPOs) and recovery time objectives (RTOs) that determine how much data loss, if any, is acceptable and how long a recovery can take without causing significant damage to the organization. RPOs determine how often backups are taken and thus balance cost for storage versus the potential for data loss. Shorter RTOs mean the organization needs to make choices that allow for faster restoration, which may also drive costs as well as require designs that allow for quick restoration, thus also influencing costs. You'll find additional coverage of RTOs and RPOs in Chapter 17, “Risk Management and Privacy.”"

      "As you prepare for the exam, make sure you understand recovery, replication, and journaling. What is involved in recovery processes, and what impacts them? What is the difference between replication and journaling, and where would each be used?",
      "In addition to full and incremental backups, many organizations use a type of backup called a snapshot. A snapshot captures the full state of a system or device at the time the backup is completed. Snapshots are common for virtual machines (VMs), where they allow the machine state to be restored at the point in time that the snapshot was taken. Snapshots can be useful to clone systems, to go back in time to a point before a patch or upgrade was installed, or to restore a system state to a point before some other event occurred. Since they're taken live, they can also be captured while the system is running, often without significant performance impact. Like a full backup, a snapshot can consume quite a bit of space, but most virtualization systems that perform enterprise snapshots are equipped with compression and deduplication technology that helps to optimize space usage for snapshots.",
      "Images are a similar concept to snapshots, but most often they refer to a complete copy of a system or server, typically down to the bit level for the drive. This means that a restored image is a complete match to the system at the moment it was imaged. Images are a backup method of choice for servers where complex configurations may be in use, and where cloning or restoration in a short time frame may be desired. Full backups, snapshots, and images can all mean similar things, so it is good to determine the technology and terminology in use as well as the specific implications of that technology and the decisions made for its implementation in any given system or architecture.",
      "Forensic images use essentially the same technology to capture a bitwise copy of an entire storage device, although they have stronger requirements around data validation and proof of secure handling.",
      "Virtualization systems and virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) also use images to create nonpersistent systems, which are run using a “gold master” image. The gold master image is not modified when the nonpersistent system is shut down, thus ensuring that the next user has the same expected experience.",
      "In addition to these types of backups, copies of individual files can be made to retain specific individual files or directories of files. Ideally, a backup copy will be validated when it is made to ensure that the backup matches the original file. Like any of the other backup methods we have discussed, safe storage of the media that the backup copy is made on is an important element in ensuring that the backup is secure and usable.",
      "Backup media is also an important decision that organizations must make. Backup media decisions involve capacity, reliability, speed, cost, expected lifespan while storing data, how often it can be reused before wearing out, and other factors, all of which can influence the backup solution that an organization chooses. Common choices include the following:",
      "Tape has historically been one of the lowest-cost-per-capacity options for large-scale backups. While many organizations have moved to using cloud backup options, magnetic tape remains in use in large enterprises, often in the form of tape robot systems that can load and store very large numbers of tapes using a few drives and several cartridge storage slots.",
      "Disks, either in magnetic or solid-state drive form, are typically more expensive for the same backup capacity as tape but are often faster. Disks are often used in large arrays in either a network-attached storage (NAS) device or a storage area network (SAN).",
      "Optical media like Blu-ray discs and DVDs, as well as specialized optical storage systems, remain in use in some circumstances, but for capacity reasons they are not in common use as a large-scale backup tool.",
      "Flash media like microSD cards and USB thumb drives continue to be used in many places for short-term copies and even longer-term backups. Though they aren't frequently used at an enterprise scale, they are important to note as a type of media that may be used for some backups.",
      "The decision between cloud, tape, and disk storage at the enterprise level also raises the question of whether backups will be online and thus always available or if they will be offline or cloud backups and need to be retrieved from a storage location before they can be accessed. The advantage of online backups is in quick retrieval and accessibility, whereas offline backups can be kept in a secure location without power and other expenses required for their active maintenance and cloud backups can be maintained without infrastructure but with the cost and time constraints created by bringing data back through an Internet connection. Offline backups are often used to ensure that an organization cannot have a total data loss, whereas online backups help you respond to immediate issues and maintain operations.",
      "You may also encounter the term “nearline” backups—backup storage that is not immediately available but that can be retrieved within a reasonable period of time, usually without a human involved. Tape robots are a common example of nearline storage, with backup tapes accessed and their contents provided on demand by the robot.",
      "Cloud backups like Amazon's S3 Glacier and Google's Coldline Storage provide lower prices for slower access times and provide what is essentially offline storage with a nearline access model. These long-term archival storage models are used for data that is unlikely to be needed, and thus very slow and potentially costly retrieval is acceptable as long as bulk storage is inexpensive and reliable."

Instead, the code that defines them is backed up, as well as the key data that they are designed to provide or to access. This changes the equation for server and backup administrators, and methods of acquiring and maintaining backup storage are changing. It means that you, as a security professional, need to review organizational habits for backups to see if they match the new models, or if old habits may be having strange results—like backups being made of ephemeral machines, or developers trusting that a service provider will never experience data loss and thus not ensuring that critical data is backed up outside of that lone provider.",
      "Some organizations choose to utilize off-site storage for their backup media, either at a site they own and operate or through a third-party service like Iron Mountain, which specializes in storage of secure backups in environmentally controlled facilities. Off-site storage, a form of geographic diversity, helps ensure that a single disaster cannot destroy an organization's data entirely. As in our earlier discussion of geographic diversity, distance considerations are also important to ensure that a single regional disaster is unlikely to harm the off-site storage."

When the vendor was actually assessed, their off-site storage facility was a senior member of the organization's house, with drives taken home in that person's car periodically. Not only was their house close to the vendor's offices (rather than 90+ miles away in case of disaster), but the only security was that the drives were locked into a consumer-level personal safe. They were not secured during transit, nor were they encrypted. The vendor had met the letter of the requirement but not the spirit of secure off-site storage!",
      "Although traditional backup methods have used on-site storage options like tape drives, storage area networks (SANs), and network-attached storage (NAS) devices, cloud and third-party off-site backup options have continued to become increasingly common. A few important considerations come into play with cloud and off-site third-party backup options:",
      "Bandwidth requirements for both the backups themselves and restoration time if the backup needs to be restored partially or fully. Organizations with limited bandwidth or locations with low bandwidth are unlikely to be able to perform a timely restoration. This fact makes off-site options less attractive if quick restoration is required, but they remain attractive from a disaster recovery perspective to ensure that data is not lost completely.",
      "Time to retrieve files and cost to retrieve files. Solutions like Amazon’s S3 Glacier storage permit low cost storage with higher costs for retrieval and slower retrieval time as an option. Administrators need to understand storage tiering for speed, cost, and other factors, but they must also take these costs and technical capabilities into account when planning for the use of third-party and cloud backup capabilities.",
      "Reliability. Many cloud providers have extremely high advertised reliability rates for their backup and storage services, and these rates may actually beat the expected durability of local tape or disk options.",
      "New security models required for backups. Separation of accounts, additional controls, and encryption of data in the remote storage location are all common considerations for use of third-party services.",
      "Regardless of the type of backup you select, securing the backup when it is in storage and in transit using encryption is an important consideration. Backups are commonly encrypted at rest, with encryption keys required for restoration, and are also typically protected by transport layer encryption when they are transferred across a network. The security and accessibility of the keys during recovery operations is an absolutely critical design element, as organizations that cannot recover the keys to their backups have effectively lost the backups and will be unable to return to normal operation."

Response controls are controls used to allow organizations to respond to an issue, whether it is an outage, a compromise, or a disaster. Recovery controls and techniques focus on returning to normal operations. Because of this, controls that allow a response to compromise or other issues that put systems into a nontrusted or improperly configured state are important to ensure that organizations maintain service availability. The Security+ exam focuses on a handful of common response and recovery controls, which you should make sure you are familiar with.",
      "An important response control in that list is the concept of nonpersistence. This means the ability to have systems or services that are spun up and shut down as needed. Some systems are configured to revert to a known state when they are restarted; this is common in cloud environments where a code-defined system will be exactly the same as any other created and run with that code. Reversion to a known state is also possible by using snapshots in a virtualization environment or by using other tools that track changes or that use a system image or build process to create a known state at startup.",
      "One response control is the ability to return to a last-known good configuration. Windows systems build this in for the patching process, allowing a return to a System Restore point before a patch was installed.

Using live boot media means that you can boot a full operating system that can see the hardware that a system runs on and that can typically mount and access drives and other devices.

Boot sector and memory-resident viruses, bad OS patches and driver issues, and a variety of other issues can be addressed using this technique.",

High-availability solutions like those we discussed earlier in the chapter, including load balancing, content distribution networks, and clustered systems, provide the ability to respond to high-demand scenarios as well as to failures in individual systems. Scalability is a common design element and a useful response control for many systems in modern environments, where services are designed to scale across many servers instead of requiring a larger server to handle more workload. You should consider two major categories of scalability:",
      "Vertical scalability requires a larger or more powerful system or device. Vertical scalability can help when all tasks or functions need to be handled on the same system or infrastructure. Vertical scalability can be very expensive to increase, particularly if the event that drives the need to scale is not ongoing or frequent. There are, however, times when vertical scalability is required, such as for every large memory footprint application that cannot be run on smaller, less capable systems.",
      "Horizontal scaling uses smaller systems or devices but adds more of them. When designed and managed correctly, a horizontally scaled system can take advantage of the ability to transparently add and remove more resources, allowing it to adjust as needs grow or shrink. This approach also provides opportunities for transparent upgrades, patching, and even incident response.",
      "Moves to the cloud and virtualization have allowed scaling to be done more easily. Many environments support horizontal scaling with software-defined services and systems that can scale at need to meet demand while also allowing safer patching capabilities and the ability to handle failed systems by simply replacing them with another identical replacement as needed.",
      "Not every environment can be built using horizontally scalable systems, and not every software or hardware solution is well suited to those scenarios. At the same time, natural and human-created disasters, equipment failures, and a host of other issues can impact the ability of an organization to operate its facilities and datacenters.",
      "When an organization needs to plan for how it would operate if its datacenter or other infrastructure hosting locations were offline, it considers site resilience options as a response control. Site resiliency has historically been part of site considerations for organizations, and for some it remains a critical design element. Three major types of disaster recovery sites are used for site resilience:",

Because of this, some organizations operate them full time, splitting traffic and load between multiple sites to ensure that the sites are performing properly. This approach also ensures that staff are in place in case of an emergency.",

Warm sites are expensive to maintain because of the hardware costs, but they can reduce the total time to restoration because systems can be ready to go and mostly configured. They balance costs and capabilities between hot sites and cold sites.",
      "Cold sites have space, power, and often network connectivity but they are not prepared with systems or data. This means that in a disaster an organization knows they would have a place to go but would have to bring or acquire systems. Cold sites are challenging because some disasters will prevent the acquisition of hardware, and data will have to be transported from another facility where it is stored in case of disaster. However, cold sites are also the least expensive option to maintain of the three types.",
      "In each of these scenarios, the restoration order needs to be considered. Restoration order decisions balance the criticality of systems and services to the operation of the organization against the need for other infrastructure to be in place and operational to allow each component to be online, secure, and otherwise running properly.

Disaster recovery planning needs to take into account the fact that the staff for a facility may be impacted if a disaster occurs.",
      "An increasing number of designs use the cloud to replace or work in tandem with existing recovery sites. Major cloud infrastructure vendors design across multiple geographic regions and often have multiple datacenters linked inside a region as well. This means that rather than investing in a hot site, organizations can build and deploy their infrastructure in a cloud-hosted environment, and then either use tools to replicate their environment to another region or architect (or rearchitect) their design to take advantage of multiple regions from the start. Since cloud services are typically priced on a usage basis, designing and building an infrastructure that can be spun up in another location as needed can help with both capacity and disaster recovery scenarios.",
      "While it's relatively rare now, multicloud systems can also help address this resilience need. Large-scale organizations that need continuous operations may opt to use multiple cloud vendors to help ensure that their systems will continue to operate even if a cloud vendor has a problem. That's a level of investment that's beyond most organizations, but it is becoming more accessible as multicloud management and deployment tools mature.",

While organizations that maintain their own datacenters are often worried about natural and human-made disasters, cloud operations have also taught organizations that cloud providers experience issues in availability zones that may not always impact other zones.

      "Resilience requires capacity planning to ensure that capacity—including staff, technology, and infrastructure—is available when needed. Historically, this required significant investment in physical infrastructure to handle increased load or to ensure disaster recovery activities could succeed even if a primary location or datacenter were taken offline. Cloud services have allowed many organizations to be more flexible by relying on third-party solutions to address technology and infrastructure needs.",
      "The Security+ exam outline focuses on three areas for capacity planning:",
      "People, where staffing and skillsets are necessary to deal with increased scale and disasters. Capacity planning for staff can be challenging since quickly staffing up in an emergency is hard. Instead, organizations typically ensure that they have sufficient staff to ensure that appropriate coverage levels exist. They may also hire staff in multiple locations to ensure coverage exists throughout their business day, with large organizations having global staffing. That doesn't mean that it isn't possible to address staffing capacity through third parties. Support contracts, consultants, and even using cloud services that support technologies instead of requiring in-house staff are all options that organizations commonly put into place to handle capacity needs.",
      "Technology capacity planning focuses on understanding the technologies that an organization has deployed and its ability to scale as needed. An example of a technology-based capacity planning exercise might include the capacity capabilities of a web server tool, a load balancer, or a storage device's throughput and read/write rates. This is tightly tied to infrastructure capacity planning and may be difficult to distinguish in many cases.",
      "Infrastructure, where underlying systems and networks may need to scale. This can include network connectivity, throughput, storage, and any other element of infrastructure that may be needed to handle either changing loads or to support disaster recovery and business continuity efforts."

You need to be aware of these methods, which are listed here in order of how much potential they have to disrupt an organization's operations as part of the testing:",
      "Tabletop exercises use discussions between personnel assigned roles needed for the plan to validate the plan. This helps to determine if there are missing components or processes. Tabletop exercises are the least potentially disruptive of the testing methods but also have the least connection to reality and may not detect issues that other methods would.",
      "Simulation exercises are drills or practices in which personnel simulate what they would do in an actual event. It is important to ensure that all staff know that the exercise is a simulation, as performing actual actions may cause disruptions.",
      "Parallel processing exercises move processing to a hot site or alternate/backup system or facility to validate that the backup can perform as expected. This has the potential for disruption if the processing is not properly separated and the parallel system or site attempts to take over for the primary's data processing.",
      "Failover exercises test full failover to an alternate site or system, and they have the greatest potential for disruption but also provide the greatest chance to fully test in a real-world scenario.",
      "Regardless of the type of testing that an organization conducts, it is important to take notes, review what was done, what worked and did not work properly, and to apply lessons learned to resilience and recovery controls, processes, and procedures to improve them."

While security practitioners often focus on technical controls, one of the most important lines of defense for an organization is the set of physical controls that it puts in place. Physical access to systems, facilities, and networks is one of the easiest ways to circumvent technical controls, whether by directly accessing a machine, stealing drives or devices, or plugging into a trusted network to bypass layers of network security control keeping it safe from the outside world."

    "sectionTitle": "Site Security",
    "headingLevel": 3,
    "paragraphs": [
      "The first step in preventing physical access is by implementing a site security plan. Site security looks at the entire facility or facilities used by an organization and implements a security plan based on the threats and risks that are relevant to each specific location. That means that facilities used by an organization in different locations, or as part of different business activities, will typically have different site security plans and controls in place.",
      "Some organizations use industrial camouflage to help protect them. A common example is the nondescript location that companies pick for their call centers. Rather than making the call center a visible location for angry customers to seek out, many are largely unmarked and otherwise innocuous. Although security through obscurity is not a legitimate technical control, in the physical world being less likely to be noticed can be helpful in preventing many intrusions that might not otherwise happen.",
      "Security through obscurity is the belief that hiding resources and data will prevent or persuade malicious actors from attacking. Changing the names of important files and folders to something less obvious or replacing traditional usernames and passwords with uncommon or randomly generated passphrases are examples of security through obscurity. Although it's not a preferred control, it can be useful under some circumstances—but it shouldn't be relied on to stop attackers!",
      "Many facilities use fencing as a first line of defense. Fences act as a deterrent by both making it look challenging to access a facility and as an actual physical defense. Highly secure facilities will use multiple lines of fences, barbed wire or razor wire at the top, and other techniques to increase the security provided by the fence. Fence materials, the height of the fence, where entrances are placed and how they are designed, and a variety of other factors are all taken into consideration for security fencing.",
      "A second common physical control is the placement of bollards. Bollards are posts or obstacles like those shown in Figure 9.1 that prevent vehicles from moving through an area. Bollards may look like posts, pillars, or even planters, but their purpose remains the same: preventing vehicle access. Some bollards are designed to be removable or even mechanically actuated so that they can be raised and lowered as needed. Many are placed in front of entrances to prevent both accidents and intentional attacks using vehicles.",
      "Lighting plays a part in exterior and interior security. Bright lighting that does not leave shadowed or dark areas is used to discourage intruders and to help staff feel safer. Automated lighting can also help indicate where staff are active, allowing security guards and other staff members to know where occupants are."

      "A newer concern for organizations is the broad use of drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Drones can be used to capture images of a site, to deliver a payload, or even to take action like cutting a wire or blocking a camera. Although drone attacks aren't a critical concern for most organizations, they are increasingly an element that needs to be considered. Antidrone systems include systems that can detect the wireless signals and electromagnetic emissions of drones, or the heat they produce via infrared sensors, acoustic systems that listen for the sounds of drones, radar that can detect the signature of a drone flying in the area, and, of course, optical systems that can recognize drones. Once they are spotted, a variety of techniques may be used against drones, ranging from kinetic systems that seek to shoot down or disable drones, to drone-jamming systems that try to block their control signals or even hijack them.",
      "Of course, laws also protect drones as property, and shooting down or disabling a drone on purpose may have expensive repercussions for the organization or individual who does so. This is a quickly changing threat for organizations, and one that security professionals will have to keep track of on an ongoing basis.",
      "Inside a facility, physical security is deployed in layers much like you would find in a technical security implementation. Many physical controls can be used; the Security+ exam outline includes specific examples that you will need to be familiar with for the test. Over the next few pages, we will explore each of those topics.",
      "Access badges can play a number of roles in physical security. In addition to being used for entry access via magnetic stripe and radio frequency ID (RFID) access systems, badges often include a picture and other information that can quickly allow personnel and guards to determine if the person is who they say they are, what areas or access they should have, and if they are an employee or a guest. This also makes badges a target for social engineering attacks by attackers who want to acquire, copy, or falsify a badge as part of their attempts to get past security. Badges are often used with proximity readers, which use RFID to query a badge without requiring it to be inserted or swiped through a magnetic stripe reader.",
      "Some organizations use access control vestibules (often called mantraps) as a means to ensure that only authorized individuals gain access to secure areas and that attackers do not use piggybacking attacks to enter places they shouldn't be. An access control vestibule is a pair of doors that both require some form of authorized access to open (see Figure 9.2). The first door opens after authorization and closes, and only after it is closed can the person who wants to enter provide their authorization to open the second door. That way, a person following behind (piggybacking) will be noticed and presumably will be asked to leave or will be reported.",

      "The Security+ exam outline doesn't cover a few common elements that you'll want to keep in mind outside of the exam. These include alarms, fire suppression systems, and locks.",
      "Alarms and alarm systems are used to detect and alert about issues, including unauthorized access, environmental problems, and fires. Alarm systems may be locally or remotely monitored, and they can vary significantly in complexity and capabilities. Much like alerts from computer-based systems, alarms that alert too often or with greater frequency are likely to be ignored, disabled, or worked around by staff. In fact, some penetration testers will even find ways to cause alarms to go off repeatedly so that when they conduct a penetration test and the alarm goes off staff will not be surprised and won't investigate the alarm that the penetration tester actually caused!",
      "Fire suppression systems are an important part of safety systems and help with resilience by reducing the potential for disastrous fires. One of the most common types of fire suppression system is sprinkler systems. There are four major types, including wet sprinkler systems, which have water in them all the time; dry sprinklers, which are empty until needed; pre-action sprinklers, which fill when a potential fire is detected and then release at specific sprinkler heads as they are activated by heat; and deluge sprinklers, which are empty, with open sprinkler heads, until they are activated and then cover an entire area.",
      "Water-based sprinkler systems are not the only type of fire suppression system in common use. Gaseous agents, which displace oxygen, reduce heat, or help prevent the ability of oxygen and materials to combust, are often used in areas such as datacenters, vaults, and art museums where water might not be a viable or safe option. Chemical agents, including both wet and dry agents, are used as well; examples are foam-dispensing systems used in airport hangars and dry chemical fire extinguishers used in home and other places.",
      "Locks are one of the most common physical security controls you will encounter. A variety of lock types are commonly deployed, ranging from traditional physical locks that use a key, push buttons, or other code entry mechanisms, to locks that use biometric identifiers such as fingerprints, to electronic mechanisms connected to computer systems with card readers or passcodes associated with them. Locks can be used to secure spaces and devices or to limit access to those who can unlock them. Cable locks are a common solution to ensure that devices like computers or other hardware are not removed from a location.",
      "Although locks are heavily used, they are also not a real deterrent for most determined attackers. Locks can be bypassed, picked, or otherwise disabled if attackers have time and access to the lock. Thus, locks are not considered a genuine physical security control. A common phrase among security professionals is, “Locks keep honest people honest.”"

Guards can make decisions that technical control systems cannot, and they can provide additional capabilities by offering both detection and response capabilities. Guards are commonly placed in reception areas, deployed to roam around facilities, and stationed in security monitoring centers with access to cameras and other sensors.",
      "Visitor logs are a common control used in conjunction with security guards. A guard can validate an individual's identity, ensure that they enter only the areas they are supposed to, and ensure that they have signed a visitor log and that their signature matches a signature on file or on their ID card. Each of these can be faked; however, an alert security guard can significantly increase the security of a facility.",
      "Security guards also bring their own challenges; humans can be fallible, and social engineering attempts can persuade guards to violate policies or even to provide attackers with assistance. Guards are also relatively expensive, requiring ongoing pay, whereas technical security controls are typically installed and maintained at lower costs. Consequently, guards are a solution that is deployed only where there is a specific need for their capabilities in most organizations."

Cameras come in a broad range of types, including black and white, infrared, and color cameras, with each type suited to specific scenarios. In addition to the type of camera, the resolution of the camera, whether it is equipped with zoom lenses, and whether it has a pan/tilt/zoom (PTZ) capability are all factors in how well it works for its intended purpose and how much it will cost. Two common features for modern camera systems are motion and object detection:",

A variety of factors can play into their accuracy, including the sets of faces they were trained on, the use of masks, or even the application of “dazzle paint” designed to confuse cameras.",

Motion and noise sensors are used as security sensors, or to turn on or off environment control systems based on occupancy. Temperature and moisture sensors help maintain datacenter environments and other areas that require careful control of the environment, as well as for other monitoring purposes.",
      "Sensors are another way to provide security monitoring. The Security+ exam outline covers four specific types of sensors that you'll need to be aware of:",
      "Infrared sensors rely on infrared light, or heat radiation. They look for changes in infrared radiation in a room or space and alert when that change occurs. They are inexpensive and commonly deployed in well-controlled, smaller indoor spaces.",
      "Pressure sensors detect a change in pressure. While not commonly deployed in most environments, they may be used when an organization needs to detect an object being moved or when someone is moving through an area using a pressure-plate or pad. While less common now, pressure sensors were commonly used to activate exit doors in the past.",
      "Microwave sensors use a baseline for a room or space that is generated by detecting normal responses when the space is at a baseline. When those responses to the microwaves sent out by the sensor change, they will trigger. They are generally more sensitive and more capable than infrared sensors. They can detect motion through materials that infrared sensors cannot and since they're not heat-based they can work through a broader range of temperatures. This means that they're typically more expensive and that they're often more error prone than infrared due to their additional sensitivity.",
      "Ultrasonic sensors are uncommon in commercial security systems but may be used in specific circumstances. Ultrasonic sensors can be set off by machinery or other vibrations, and they can have environmental effects on human occupants. Ultrasonic sensors are more commonly used in applications where proximity detection is required."

At the same time, techniques like the use of geographic dispersal, power protection, and even diversity of technologies and vendors can play a critical role in keeping your organization online and operational.",
      "Resilience relies on a variety of technical and procedural design elements. Geographic diversity helps ensure that a natural disaster or human-caused issue doesn't take down your organization. High-availability designs using clustering and load balancing handle both scaling and system and component failures. Multicloud systems and platform diversity are used to avoid a vendor's outage or failure from causing broader issues. Backup power from generators and UPS systems helps control power-related events.",
      "Backups, whether to tape, disk, or third-party storage services, help ensure that data is not lost if something happens to systems or drives. You should know the difference between a full backup, a differential backup, and an incremental backup. Snapshots, which copy the state of a system at a point in time, and images, which are used to copy a complete system, are also used as ways to both back up and clone systems. Journaling records changes, allowing for them to be replicated if needed.",

Site security involves using controls to make facilities less likely to be targeted, using controls like fences, bollards, lighting, access badges, and entry access systems to dissuade potential bad actors.

      "Redundancy builds resilience. Redundant systems, networks, and even datacenters are a key element in ensuring availability. Redundant designs need to address the organizational risks and priorities that your organization faces to ensure the best trade-offs between cost and capabilities. Geographic dispersal; load balancers and clustering; power protection and redundancy; RAID; backups; and diversity of technologies, systems, cloud service providers, and platforms are all ways to build and ensure resiliency. Considerations include availability, resilience, cost, responsiveness, scalability, ease of deployment, risk transference, ease of recovery, patch availability, inability to patch, power, and compute. Capacity planning helps to ensure that there is enough capacity to handle issues and outages including ensuring you have enough people, technology, and infrastructure to recover. Multicloud environments as well as platform diversity can help ensure that a single technology or provider's outage or issue does not take your organization offline, but they create additional complexity and costs.",
      "Backups help ensure organizations can recover from events and issues. Backups are designed to meet an organization's restoration needs, including how long it takes to recover from an issue and how much data may be lost between backups. Backup locations and frequency are determined based on the organization's risk profile and recovery needs, with offsite backups being a preferred solution to avoid losing backups in the same disaster as the source systems. Snapshots, journaling, and replication each have roles to play in ensuring data is available and accessible. Encryption is used to keep backups secure both in-transit and at rest.",
      "Response and recovery are critical when failures occur. Failures will occur, so you need to know how to respond. Having a disaster recovery location, like a hot, warm, or cold site or a redundant cloud or hosted location, can help ensure that your organization can return to operations more quickly. Having a predetermined restoration order provides a guideline on what needs to be brought back online first due to either dependencies or importance to the organization. Testing, including tabletop exercises, failover testing, simulations, and parallel processing, are all common ways to ensure response and recovery will occur as planned.",
      "Physical security controls are a first line of defense. Keeping your site secure involves security controls like fences, lighting, alarms, bollards, access control vestibules, cameras, and other sensors. Ensuring that only permitted staff are allowed in using locks, badges, and guards helps prevent unauthorized visitors. Sensors must be selected to match the environment and needs of the organization. Infrared, ultrasonic, pressure, and microwave sensors have different capabilities and costs.

      "Cloud computing can be an intimidating term, but the fundamental idea is straightforward: cloud service providers deliver computing services to their customers over the Internet. This can be as simple as Google providing their Gmail service to customers in a web browser or Amazon Web Services (AWS) providing virtualized servers to corporate clients who use them to build their own technology environment. In each of these cases, the provider builds an IT service and uses the Internet to deliver that service to its customers.",
      "Here's a more formal definition of cloud computing from the National Institute of Standards and Technology:",
      "Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.",
      "Let's walk through some of the components of that definition. Cloud computing is ubiquitous and convenient. The resources provided by the cloud are available to customers wherever they may be. If you have access to the Internet, you can access the cloud. It doesn't matter whether you're sitting in your office or on the beach.",
      "Cloud computing is also on-demand. In most cases, you can provision and deprovision cloud resources in a few minutes with a few clicks. You can acquire new cloud resources almost immediately when you need them and you can turn them off quickly (and stop paying for them!) when they are no longer required.",
      "Many of the key benefits of the cloud derive from the fact that it uses a shared pool of resources that may be configured for different purposes by different users. This sharing allows oversubscription because not everyone will use all their resources at the same time and it achieves economies of scale. The fact that many different users share resources in the same cloud infrastructure is known as multitenancy. In a multitenant environment, the same physical hardware might support the workloads and storage needs of many different customers, all of whom operate without any knowledge of or interaction with their fellow customers.",
      "The cloud offers a variety of configurable computing resources. We'll talk about the different cloud service models later in this chapter, but you can acquire infrastructure components, platforms, or entire applications through cloud service providers and then configure them to meet your needs.",
      "The rapid provisioning and releasing of cloud services also takes place with minimal management effort and service provider interaction. Unlike on-premises hardware acquisition, you can provision cloud services yourself without dealing with account representatives and order processing times. If you need a new cloud server, you don't need to call up Microsoft, Amazon, or Google. You just click a few buttons on their website and you're good to go. From the perspective of most users, the cloud presents seemingly infinite capacity."

      "As organizations consider the appropriate role for the cloud in their technology infrastructure, the key issue they seek to address is the appropriate balance of on-premises versus cloud/off-premises resources. The correct balance will vary from organization to organization. Understanding some of the key benefits provided by the cloud is helpful to finding that correct balance:",
      "On-demand self-service computing. Cloud resources are available when and where you need them. This provides developers and technologists with incredible agility, reducing cycle times and increasing the speed of deployment.",
      "Scalability. As the demand for a cloud-based service increases, customers can manually or automatically increase the capacity of their operations. In some cloud environments, the cloud service provider may do this in a manner that is completely transparent to the customer, scaling resources behind the scenes. Cloud providers achieve scalability in two ways: Vertical scaling increases the capacity of existing servers, as shown in Figure 10.1(a). For example, you might change the number of CPU cores or the amount of memory assigned to a server. In the physical world, this means opening up a server and adding physical hardware. In the cloud, you can just click a few buttons and add memory or compute capacity.",
      "Horizontal scaling adds more servers to a pool of clustered servers, as shown in Figure 10.1(b). If you run a website that supports 2,000 concurrent users with two servers, you might add a new server every time your typical usage increases another 1,000 users.",
      "FIGURE 10.1 (a) Vertical scaling vs. (b) Horizontal scaling",
      "Elasticity. Elasticity and scalability are closely related. Scalability is focused on rapidly increasing capacity. Elasticity says that capacity should expand and contract as needs change to optimize costs. If your website starts to experience a burst in activity, elasticity allows you to add servers automatically until that capacity is met and then remove those servers when the capacity is no longer needed.",
      "Measured service. Everything you do in the cloud is measured by the provider. Providers track the number of seconds of processing time you consume, the amount of storage you occupy, the number of log entries that you generate, and many other measures. They use this information to be able to assess charges based on your usage. You pay for exactly what you use—no more and no less.",
      "Agility and flexibility. The speed to provision cloud resources and the ability to use them for short periods of time lends tremendous agility and flexibility to technology organizations. Developers and engineers who wish to try a new idea can rapidly spin up a test environment, evaluate the approach, and decide whether to move it into production with minimal effort and cost."

For example, if the PaaS platform provides runtime interpreters for customer code, the cloud provider is responsible for the security of those interpreters.",

For example, organizations subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) should work with cloud providers to document the specific controls and responsibilities for meeting each one of the many PCI DSS requirements.

      "Explain the three major cloud service models. In the anything-as-a-service (XaaS) approach to computing, there are three major cloud service models. Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) offerings allow customers to purchase and interact with the basic building blocks of a technology infrastructure. Software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings provide customers with access to a fully managed application running in the cloud. Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offerings provide a platform where customers may run applications that they have developed themselves.",
      "Describe the four major cloud deployment models. Public cloud service providers deploy infrastructure and then make it accessible to any customers who wish to take advantage of it in a multitenant model. The term private cloud is used to describe any cloud infrastructure that is provisioned for use by a single customer. A community cloud service shares characteristics of both the public and private models. Community cloud services do run in a multitenant environment, but the tenants are limited to members of a specifically designed community. Hybrid cloud is a catch-all term used to describe cloud deployments that blend public, private, and/or community cloud services together.",
      "Understand the shared responsibility model of cloud security. Under the shared responsibility model of cloud security, cloud customers must divide responsibilities between one or more service providers and the customers' own cybersecurity teams. In an IaaS environment, the cloud provider takes on the most responsibility, providing security for everything below the operating system layer. In PaaS, the cloud provider takes over added responsibility for the security of the operating system itself. In SaaS, the cloud provider is responsible for the security of the entire environment, except for the configuration of access controls within the application and the choice of data to store in the service.",
      "Implement appropriate security controls in a cloud environment. Cloud customers should understand how to use the controls offered by providers and third parties to achieve their security objectives. This includes maintaining resource policies and designing resilient cloud implementations that achieve high availability across multiple zones. From a storage perspective, cloud customers should consider permissions, encryption, replication, and high availability. From a network perspective, cloud customers should consider the design of virtual networks with public and private subnets to achieve appropriate segmentation. From a compute perspective, customers should design security groups that appropriately restrict network traffic to instances and maintain the security of those instances."

It is tightly connected to the hardware of a device and may or may not be possible to update depending on the design and implementation of the device's hardware. Computer and mobile device firmware is typically capable of being updated but may require manual updates rather than being part of an automated update process.",

An example of this is 2022's MoonBounce malware, which is remotely installable and targets a computer's Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) flash memory. Once there, it will persist through reboots and reinstallations of the operating system. You can read more about MoonBounce at www.tomshardware.com/news/moonbounce-malware-hides-in-your-bios-chip-persists-after-drive-formats. PC UEFI attacks aren't the only firmware attacks in the wild, however. News broke in 2023 of millions of infected Android devices that were shipped with malware in their firmware, meaning that purchasers couldn't trust their brand-new devices!",

Once a device or system has reached end-of-life, they typically will also reach the end of their support from the manufacturer. Without further updates such as security fixes, you will be unable to address security problems directly and will need compensating controls, which may or may not be usable and appropriate for customer organizations.",

      "Fortunately, modern Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) firmware (the replacement for the traditional Basic Input/Output System [BIOS]) can leverage two different techniques to ensure that the system is secure. Secure boot ensures that the system boots using only software that the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) trusts. To perform a secure boot operation, the system must have a signature database listing the secure signatures of trusted software and firmware for the boot process (see Figure 11.1).",

      "The second security feature intended to help prevent boot-level malware is measured boot. These boot processes measure each component, starting with the firmware and ending with the boot start drivers. Measured boot does not validate against a known good list of signatures before booting; instead, it relies on the UEFI firmware to hash the firmware, bootloader, drivers, and anything else that is part of the boot process. The data gathered is stored in the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), and the logs can be validated remotely to let security administrators know the boot state of the system. This boot attestation process allows comparison against known good states, and administrators can take action if the measured boot shows a difference from the accepted or secure known state. This process allows the remote server to make decisions about the state of the system based on the information it provides, allowing access control and quarantine options.",

For a deeper dive into UEFI and TPM, read the Infosec Institute's write-up at http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/uefi-and-tpm. Windows has a Trusted Boot process that allows the operating system to check the integrity of the components involved in the startup process.",

This means that the system or device inherently trusts the hardware root of trust and that it needs to be secure.

    "paragraphs": [
      "The term sandbox describes an isolated environment where potentially dangerous or problematic software can be run. Major antimalware sites, tools, and vendors all use sandboxing techniques to test potential malware samples. Some use multiple antimalware tools running in virtual environments to validate samples, and others use highly instrumented sandboxes to track every action taken by malware once it is run. Of course, there is a constant battle between malware authors and antimalware companies as malware creators look for ways to detect sandboxes so that they can prevent their tools from being analyzed and as antimalware companies develop new tools to defeat those techniques.",
      "Commercial and open source sandbox technologies are available, including Cuckoo sandbox, an automated malware analysis tool. You can read more about Cuckoo at http://cuckoosandbox.org. You'll also find sandboxing capabilities built into advanced antimalware tools, so you may already have sandboxing available to your organization.",
      "Antimalware tools can be installed on mobile devices, desktops, and other endpoints like the devices and systems that handle network traffic and email, and anywhere else that malicious software could attack or be detected. Using an antimalware package has been a consistent recommendation from security professionals for years since it is a last line of defense against systems being infected or compromised. That also means that attackers have focused on bypassing and defeating antimalware programs, including using the same tools as part of their testing for new malicious software.",
      "As you consider deploying antimalware tools, it is important to keep a few key decisions in mind. First, you need to determine what threats you are likely to face and where they are likely to be encountered. In many organizations, a majority of malicious software threats are encountered on individual workstations and laptops, or are sent and received via email. Antimalware product deployments are thus focused on those two areas.",
      "Second, management, deployment, and monitoring for tools is critical in an enterprise environment. Antimalware tools that allow central visibility and reporting integrate with other security tools for an easy view of the state of your systems and devices. Third, the detection capabilities you deploy and the overall likelihood of your antimalware product to detect, stop, and remove malicious software plays a major role in decision processes. Since malware is a constantly evolving threat, many organizations choose to deploy more than one antimalware technology, hoping to increase the likelihood of detection."

      "One way to prevent malicious software from being used on systems is to control the applications that can be installed or used. That's where the use of allow list and deny or block list tools come in. Allow list tools allow you to build a list of software, applications, and other system components that are allowed to exist and run on a system. If they are not on the list, they will be removed or disabled, or they will not be able to be installed. Block lists, or deny lists, are lists of software or applications that cannot be installed or run, rather than a list of what is allowed. The choice between the solutions depends on what administrators and security professionals want to accomplish. If a system requires extremely high levels of security, an allow list will provide greater security than a block or deny list, but if specific programs are considered undesirable, a block list is less likely to interfere with unknown or new applications or programs.",
      "Although these tools may sound appealing, they do not see widespread deployment in most organizations because of the effort required to maintain the lists. Limited deployments and specific uses are more common throughout organizations, and other versions of allow and block lists are implemented in the form of firewalls and similar protective technologies."

EDR tools combine monitoring capabilities on endpoint devices and systems using a client or software agent with network monitoring and log analysis capabilities to collect, correlate, and analyze events. Key features of EDR systems are the ability to search and explore the collected data and to use it for investigations as well as the ability to detect suspicious data.",
      "With the continued growth of security analytics tools, EDR systems tend to look for anomalies and indicators of compromise (IoCs) using automated rules and detection engines as well as allowing manual investigation. The power of an EDR system comes in its ability to make this detection and reporting capability accessible and useful for organizations that are dealing with very large quantities of security data.",
      "If you are considering an EDR deployment, you will want to pay attention to organizational needs like the ability to respond to incidents; the ability to handle threats from a variety of sources, ranging from malware to data breaches; and the ability to filter and review large quantities of endpoint data in the broader context of your organizations.",
      "In addition to EDR, extended detection and response (XDR) tools are increasingly commonly deployed by organizations. XDR is similar to EDR but has a broader perspective considering not only endpoints but the full breadth of an organization's technology stack, including cloud services, security services and platforms, email, and similar components. They ingest logs and other information from the broad range of components, then use detection algorithms as well as artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze the data to find issues and help security staff respond to them."

These tools also commonly have network and server-resident components to ensure that data is managed throughout its life cycle and various handling processes.",
      "Key elements of DLP systems include the ability to classify data so that organizations know which data should be protected; data labeling or tagging functions, to support classification and management practices; policy management and enforcement functions used to manage data to the standards set by the organization; and monitoring and reporting capabilities, to quickly notify administrators or security practitioners about issues or potential problems.",
      "Some DLP systems also provide additional functions that encrypt data when it is sent outside of protected zones. In addition, they may include capabilities intended to allow sharing of data without creating potential exposure, either tokenizing, wiping, or otherwise modifying data to permit its use without violation of the data policies set in the DLP environment.",
      "Mapping your organization's data, and then applying appropriate controls based on a data classification system or policy, is critical to success with a DLP system. Much like antimalware and EDR systems, some DLP systems also track user behaviors to identify questionable behavior or common mistakes like assigning overly broad permissions on a file or sharing a sensitive document via email or a cloud file service.",
      "Of course, even with DLP in place there are likely to be ways around the system. Taking a picture of a screen, cutting and pasting, or printing sensitive data can all allow malicious or careless users to extract data from an environment even if effective and well-managed data loss prevention tools are in place. Thus, DLP systems are part of a layered security infrastructure that combines technical and administrative solutions such as data loss prevention with policies, awareness, and other controls based on the risks that the organization and its data face."

A HIPS can take action on that traffic, including filtering out malicious traffic or blocking specific elements of the data that is received. A HIPS will look at traffic that is split across multiple packets or throughout an entire series of communications, allowing it to catch malicious activity that may be spread out or complex. Since a HIPS can actively block traffic, misidentification of traffic as malicious, misconfiguration, or other issues can cause legitimate traffic to be blocked, potentially causing an outage. If you choose to deploy a HIPS or any other tool that can actively block traffic, you need to consider what would happen if something did go wrong."

The HIPS had a module that analyzed Microsoft-specific protocols looking for potential attacks, and a Windows update introduced new flags and other elements to the protocol used by the Windows systems as part of their normal communication. Since the HIPS wasn't updated to know about those changes, it blocked the backend traffic between Windows systems in the domain. Unfortunately, that meant that almost the entire Windows domain went offline since the HIPS blocked much of the communication it relied on. The issue left the systems administrators with a negative feeling for the HIPS, and it was removed from service. It took years until the organization was comfortable deploying a HIPS-style security tool in the datacenter again.",
      "A host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) performs similar functions, but, like a network-based intrusion detection system (IDS), it cannot take action to block traffic. Instead, a HIDS can only report and alert on issues. Therefore, a HIDS has limited use for real-time security, but it has a much lower likelihood of causing issues.",
      "Before deploying and managing host-based firewalls, HIPSs, or HIDSs, determine how you will manage them, how complex the individual configurations will be, and what would happen if the host-based protections had problems. That doesn't mean you shouldn't deploy them! Granular controls are an important part of a zero-trust design, and armoring hosts helps ensure that a compromised system behind a security boundary does not result in broader issues for organizations.",
      "Figure 11.2 shows typical placement of a host-based firewall, a HIPS, and a HIDS, as well as where a network firewall or IPS/IDS device might be placed. Note that traffic can move from system to system behind the network security devices without those devices seeing it due to the network switch that the traffic flows through. In organizational networks, these security boundaries may be for very large network segments, with hundreds or even thousands of systems that could potentially communicate without being filtered by a network security device.",

After all, if attackers cannot connect to the system remotely, they'll have a much harder time exploiting the system directly. Port scanners are commonly used to quickly assess which ports are open on systems on a network, allowing security practitioners to identify and prioritize hardening targets. The easy rule of thumb for hardening is that only services and ports that must be available to provide necessary services should be open, and that those ports and services should be limited to only the networks or systems that they need to interact with. Unfortunately for many servers, this may mean that the systems need to be open to the world.",

Once baselines are set, tools support configuration enforcement, a process that not only monitors for changes but makes changes to system configurations as needed to ensure that the configuration remains in its desired state.",

      "Ensuring that systems and software are up to date helps ensure endpoint security by removing known vulnerabilities. Timely patching decreases how long exploits and flaws can be used against systems, but patching also has its own set of risks. Patches may introduce new flaws, or the patching process itself can sometimes cause issues. The importance of patching, as well as the need to make sure that patching is controlled and managed, is where patch management comes in.",
      "A significant proportion of modern software, including software, browsers, office suites, and many other packages, has built-in automatic update tools. These tools check for an update and either notify the user requesting permission to install the updates or automatically install the update. Although this model is useful for individual devices, an enterprise solution makes sense for organizations.",
      "Patch management for operating systems can be done using tools like Microsoft's Configuration Manager for Windows, but third-party tools provide support for patch management across a wide variety of software applications. Tracking versions and patch status using a systems management tool can be important for organizational security, particularly because third-party updates for the large numbers of applications and packages that organizations are likely to have deployed can be a daunting task.",
      "A common practice for many organizations is to delay the installation of a patch for a period of a few days from its release date. That allows the patch to be installed on systems around the world, hopefully providing insight into any issues the patch may create. In cases where a known exploit exists, organizations have to choose between the risk of patching and the risk of not patching and having the exploit used against them. Testing can help, but many organizations don't have the resources to do extensive patch testing.",
      "Managing software for mobile devices remains a challenge, but mobile device management tools also include the ability to validate software versions. These tools often have the ability to update applications, and apply patches and software updates to the device operating system in addition to controlling security settings.",

Key features like reporting, the ability to determine which systems or applications get updates and when, the ability to block an update, and of course being able to force updates to be installed are all critical to enterprise patch management over the many different types of devices in our organizations today."

      "Keeping the contents of disks secure protects data in the event that a system or disk is lost or stolen. That's where disk encryption comes in. Full-disk encryption (FDE) encrypts the disk and requires that the bootloader or a hardware device provide a decryption key and software or hardware to decrypt the drive for use. One of the most common implementations of this type of encryption is transparent encryption (sometimes called on-the-fly, or real-time, encryption). Transparent encryption implementations are largely invisible to the user, with the drive appearing to be unencrypted during use. This also means that the simplest attack against a system that uses transparent FDE is to gain access to the system while the drive is unlocked.",
      "Volume encryption (sometimes called filesystem-level encryption) protects specific volumes of the drive, allowing different trust levels and additional security beyond that provided by encrypting the entire disk with a single key. File and folder encryption methods can also be used to protect specific data, again allowing for different trust levels as well as transfer of data in secure ways.",
      "Full-disk encryption can be implemented at the hardware level using a self-encrypting drive (SED). Self-encrypting drives implement encryption capabilities in their hardware and firmware. Systems equipped with a self-encrypting drive require a key to boot from the drive, which may be entered manually or provided by a hardware token or device. Since this is a form of full-disk encryption, the same sort of attack methods work—simply find a logged-in system or one that is in sleep mode.",
      "Disk encryption does bring potential downfalls. If the encryption key is lost, the data on the drive will likely be unrecoverable since the same strong encryption that protects it will make it very unlikely that you will be able to brute-force the key and acquire the data. Technical support can be more challenging, and data corruption or other issues can have a larger impact, resulting in unrecoverable data. Despite these potential downfalls, the significant advantage of full-disk encryption is that a lost or stolen system with a fully encrypted drive can often be handled as a loss of the system instead of a loss or breach of the data that system contained."

Industrial controls systems (ICSs) is a broad term for industrial automation, and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) often refers to large systems that run power and water distribution or other systems that cover large areas. Since the terms overlap, they are often used interchangeably.",

SCADA systems are commonly found running complex manufacturing and industrial processes, where the ability to monitor, adjust, and control the entire process is critical to success.",

You'll see that there are remote telemetry units (RTUs) that collect data from sensors and programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that control and collect data from industrial devices like machines or robots. Data is sent to the system control and monitoring controls, allowing operators to see what is going on and to manage the SCADA system. These capabilities mean that SCADA systems are in common use in industrial and manufacturing environments, as well as in the energy industry to monitor plants and even in the logistics industry tracking packages and complex sorting and handling systems.",

You won't need to know the differences for the exam, but you should be aware that your organization or vendor may use RTU to mean one or more of those things. Regardless of which term is in use, an RTU will use a microprocessor to control a device or to collect data from it to pass on to an ICS or SCADA system.",
      "ICS and SCADA can also be used to control and manage facilities, particularly when the facility requires management of things like heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems to ensure that the processes or systems are at the proper temperature and humidity.",
      "Since ICS and SCADA systems combine general-purpose computers running commodity operating systems with industrial devices with embedded systems and sensors, they present a complex security profile for security professionals to assess. In many cases, they must be addressed as individual components to identify their unique security needs, including things like customized industrial communication protocols and proprietary interfaces. Once those individual components are mapped and understood, their interactions and security models for the system as a whole or as major components can be designed and managed.",

      "The overall computational power and capacity of embedded systems is usually much lower than a traditional PC or mobile device. Although this may vary, embedded systems may use a low-power processor, have less memory, and have very limited storage space. That means that the compute power needed for cryptographic processing may not exist, or it may have to be balanced with other needs for CPU cycles. At the same time, limited memory and storage capacity mean that there may not be capacity to run additional security tools like a firewall, antimalware tools, or other security tools you're used to including in a design.",
      "Embedded systems may not connect to a network. They may have no network connectivity, or they may have it but due to environmental, operational, or security concerns it may not be enabled or used. In fact, since many embedded systems are deployed outside of traditional networks, or in areas where connectivity may be limited, even if they have a built-in wireless network capability, they may not have the effective range to connect to a viable network. Thus, you may encounter an inability to patch, monitor, or maintain the devices remotely. Embedded devices may need to be secured as an independent unit.",
      "Without network connectivity, CPU and memory capacity, and other elements, authentication is also likely to be impossible. In fact, authenticating to an embedded system may not be desirable due to safety or usability factors. Many of the devices you will encounter that use embedded systems are built into industrial machinery, sensors and monitoring systems, or even household appliances. Without authentication, other security models need to be identified to ensure that changes to the embedded system are authorized.",
      "Embedded systems may be very low cost, but many are effectively very high cost because they are a component in a larger industrial or specialized device. So, simply replacing a vulnerable device can be impossible, requiring compensating controls or special design decisions to be made to ensure that the devices remain secure and do not create issues for their home organization.",
      "Because of all these limitations, embedded devices may rely on implied trust. They presume that operators and those who interact with them will be doing so because they are trusted and that physical access to the device means that the user is authorized to use and potentially change settings, update the device, or otherwise modify it.

      "When systems and devices are at the end of their useful life cycle, organizations need to establish a decommissioning process. Decommissioning typically involves removing a device or system from service, removing it from inventory, and ensuring that no sensitive data remains on the system. In many cases that means dealing with the storage media or drive that the system relies on, but it may also mean dealing with the entire device or removable media. Ensuring that a disk is securely wiped when it is no longer needed and is being retired or when it will be reused is an important part of the lifespan for drives. Sanitizing drives or media involves one of two processes: wiping the data or destroying the media.",
      "Tapes and similar magnetic media have often been wiped using a degausser, which exposes the magnetic media to very strong electromagnetic fields, scrambling the patterns of bits written to the tape or drive. Degaussers are a relatively quick way to destroy the data on magnetic media. SSDs, optical media and drives, and flash drives, however, require different handling.",
      "Wiping media overwrites or discards the data in a nonrecoverable way. For hard drives and other magnetic media, this may be accomplished with a series of writes, typically of 1s or 0s, to every storage location (bit) on the drive. Various tools like Darik's Boot and Nuke (DBAN) will perform multiple passes over an entire disk to attempt to ensure that no data remains. In fact, data remanence, or data that is still on a disk after the fact, is a significant concern, particularly with SSD and other flash media that uses wear-leveling algorithms to spread wear and tear on the drive over more space than the listed capacity. Wiping SSDs using a traditional drive wipe utility that writes to all accessible locations will miss sections of the disk where copies of data may remain due to the wear-leveling process.",
      "Fortunately, tools that can use the built-in secure Erase command for drives like these can help make sure remnant data is not an issue. An even better solution in many cases is to use full-disk encryption for the full life of a drive and then simply discard the encryption key when the data is ready to be retired. Unless your organization faces advanced threats, this approach is likely to keep the data from being recoverable by even reasonably advanced malicious actors.",
      "Since wiping drives can have problems, destroying drives is a popular option for organizations that want to eliminate the risk of data loss or exposure. Shredding, pulverizing, or incinerating drives so that no data could possibly be recovered is an option, and third-party vendors specialize in providing services like these with a documented trail for each asset (drive or system) that is destroyed. Although this does cause a loss of some potential recoverable value, the remaining value of older drives is much less than the cost of a single breach in the risk equations for organizations that make this decision.",
      "An important step for many organizations is certification. Certification processes are used to document that assets were decommissioned, including certification processes for vendors who destroy devices and media. Certificates of destruction are provided as proof that assets were properly disposed of."

      "What happens when drives aren't wiped? One of the authors of this book encountered exactly that situation. A system belonging to a department head was retired from their daily use and handed off to a faculty member in a department on a college campus. That faculty member used the system for some time, and after they were done with it the system was handed down again to a graduate student. Over time, multiple graduate students were issued the system and they used it until the system was compromised. At that point, the incident response team learned that all of the data from the department head, faculty member, and multiple graduate students was accessible on the system and that no data had ever been removed during its lifespan. Sensitive documents, personal email, and a variety of other information was all accessible on the system! Fortunately, although the incident response team found that the system had malware, the malware was not a type that would have leaked the data. If the system had been wiped and reinstalled at any time during its many years of service, the potential significant incident could have been avoided entirely. The department now has strong rules against hand-me-down systems and wipes and reinstalls any system before it is handed to another user."

      "Endpoints are the most common devices in most organizations, and they are also the most varied. Therefore, you must pay particular attention to how they are secured from the moment they boot up. You can do this by using secure boot techniques built into the firmware of the systems themselves to preserve boot integrity while leveraging TPMs, hardware security modules, key management systems, and secure enclaves to properly handle secrets.",
      "Understanding operating system vulnerabilities and their impact in endpoint security is critical for security professionals. You also need to be aware of and understand the impact of hardware life cycles, including firmware updates and end-of-life and legacy hardware considerations.",
      "As a security professional, you need to know about the many common types of endpoint protection options that are available, as well as when and how to use them. Antivirus/antimalware software helps prevent malware infection. Host-based firewalls and IPSs, disabling ports and protocols, changing default passwords and other settings, and using security baselines are all common techniques used as part of endpoint protection. Tools like Group Policy and SELinux help to enforce and improve security baselines and capabilities. EDR and XDR tools add another layer to the set of security protections for endpoint devices by combining detection and monitoring tools with central reporting and incident response capabilities. Finally, data loss prevention (DLP) tools are deployed to ensure that data isn't inadvertently or intentionally exposed.",
      "Drive encryption keeps data secure if drives are stolen or lost. At the end of their life cycle, when devices are retired or fail, or when media needs to be reused, sanitization procedures are employed to ensure that remnant data doesn't leak. Wiping drives as well as physical destruction are both common options. It is critical to choose a sanitization method that matches the media and security level required by the data stored on the media or drive.",
      "Another important element in endpoint security is how organizations secure specialized and embedded systems. Internet of Things, SCADA, ICS, and other devices using real-time operating systems are everywhere throughout organizations in medical systems, smart meters, vehicles, industrial processes and manufacturing equipment, drones, smart devices, and a multitude of other locations. With often limited capabilities, different security models, and a host of other special requirements, securing embedded systems takes additional focus and planning to ensure they remain secure.",
      "Asset management starts with the procurement process when security considerations are taken into account and assets, including hardware, software, and data are all added to inventories and management systems when they are acquired. Ensuring that assets have an owner or responsible party and that they are classified based on the sensitivity of the services or data that they support or contain is part of the asset management process for security. Ensuring that assets are inventoried and accounted for throughout their life cycle, and that they are properly disposed of, finishes the life cycle."

      "Understand operating system and hardware vulnerabilities. Operating systems may be vulnerable, host vulnerable services or applications, or may have weak or insecure configurations that need to be addressed. Patching, configuration management, and security baselines all play a role in operating system security. Hardware security frequently focuses on firmware updates and security as well as life cycle management to properly address end-of-life and legacy hardware issues.",
      "Hardening and protecting systems relies on security tools and technology to keep systems secure. Securing endpoint devices requires considering the entire device: how it boots, how data is secured, how it is configured, what services it provides, if its communications are secure, and how it is protected against network threats. Fortunately, security professionals have a wide range of tools, including secure and trusted boot, to protect against attacks on the boot process or drivers. Antivirus, antimalware, EDR, XDR, and data loss prevention tools provide insight into what systems are doing and where issues may exist while adding more controls that administrators and security professionals can use to keep systems and data secure. Network security tools like host intrusion prevention and detection systems, host firewalls, and similar tools can detect and often stop attacks from the network.",
      "Hardening endpoints also relies on configuration, settings, policies, and standards to ensure system security. Although tools and technology are important to protect endpoints, configuration and settings are also an important part of the process. Disabling unnecessary services, changing default passwords, applying settings in the Windows Registry or operating systems settings in Linux, and otherwise using built-in and add-on configuration options to match security configurations to the device's risk profile is critical. Finally, patch management for the operating system and the applications installed on devices protects against known vulnerabilities and issues.",
      "Specialized systems like SCADA, ICS, and IoT systems exist throughout your organization and require unique security solutions. SCADA and ICS or industrial control systems are used to manage and monitor factories, power plants, and many other major components of modern companies. IoT systems are Internet-connected devices that perform a wide variety of tasks, from monitoring to home automation and more. They may be controlled by third parties or have other security implications that must be addressed as part of a security plan to keep each endpoint secure.",
      "Explain the importance of asset management for software, data, and hardware. Assets must be managed from acquisition through their life cycle until disposal or decommissioning. Proper management includes ensuring that ownership and classification are maintained and tracked, and that inventories of assets are up to date and include appropriate information to support operations, security, and incident response needs.",
      "Drive encryption and sanitization help prevent data exposure. Encrypting drives and media helps keep them secure if they are stolen or lost. Full-disk encryption covers the entire drive, whereas volume or file encryption protects portions of the contents. Sanitizing drives and media involves wiping them using a secure deletion process, or their destruction to ensure that the data cannot be recovered. Using appropriate processes based on the security requirements for the data and the type of drive or media involved is critical to making sure that the data is properly removed."

Although you're unlikely to be asked to explain a three-way handshake for TCP traffic on the Security+ exam, if you don't know what the handshake is, you'll be missing important tools in your security toolkit. Many security analysts take both the Network+ and the Security+ exam for that reason.",

This includes services, management interfaces, and any other means that attackers could obtain access to or disrupt the organization. Understanding an organization's attack surface is a key part of security and infrastructure design.",
      "Device placement is a key concern. Devices may be placed to secure a specific zone or network segment, to allow them to access traffic from a network segment, VLAN, or broader network, or may be placed due to capabilities like maximum throughput. Common placement options include at network borders, datacenter borders, and between network segments and VLANs, but devices may also be placed to protect specific infrastructure.",
      "Security zones are frequently related to device placement. Security zones are network segments, physical or virtual network segments, or other components of an infrastructure that are able to be separate from less secure zones through logical or physical means. Security zones are typically created on trust or data sensitivity boundaries but may be created for any security-related purpose that an organization may feel is important enough to create a distinct zone. Common examples include segregated guest networks, Internet-facing networks used to host web servers and other Internet accessible services, and management VLANs, which are used to access network device management ports for switches, access points, routers, and similar devices.",
      "Connectivity considerations include how the organization connects to the Internet, whether it has redundant connections, how fast the connections are, what security controls the upstream connectivity provider can make available, what type of connectivity is in use—whether it is fiber optic, copper, wireless, or some other form of connectivity, and even if the connection paths are physically separated and using different connectivity providers so that a single event cannot disrupt the organization's connectivity.",
      "Another consideration are failure modes and how the organization wants to address them. When a security device fails, should it fail so that no traffic passes it or should it fail so that all traffic passes it? These two states are known as fail-closed and fail-open, and the choice between the two is tightly linked to the organization's business objectives. If a fail-closed device fails and the organization cannot conduct business, is that a greater risk than the device failing open and the organization not having the security controls it provides available?",
      "Network taps, which are devices used to monitor or access traffic, may be active or passive. That means they're either powered or not powered. Passive devices can't lose power, and thus a potential failure mode is removed. They can also be in line, with all traffic flowing through them, or they can be set up as taps or monitors, which copy traffic instead of interacting with the original network traffic."

High availability designs will typically allow for upgrades, patching, system or service failures, changes in load, and other events without interruption of services. High availability targets are set when systems are designed and then various solutions like clustering, load balancing, and proxies are used to ensure that the solution reaches availability targets. HA design typically focuses on the ability to reliably switch between components as needed, elimination of single points of failure that could cause an outage, and the ability to detect and remediate or work around a failure if it does happen."

      "Implementation of secure protocols is a common part of ensuring that communications and services are secure. Examples of secure protocols are the use of HTTPS (TLS) instead of unencrypted HTTP, using SSH instead of Telnet, and wrapping other services using TLS. Protocol selection for most organizations will default to using the secure protocol if it exists and is supported, and security analysts will typically note the use of insecure protocols as a risk if they are discovered. Port selection is related to this, although default ports for protocols are normally preselected. Some protocols use different ports for the secure version of the protocol, like the use of port 443 for HTTPS instead of 80 for HTTP. Others like Microsoft's SQL Server use the same port and rely on client requests for TLS connections on TCP 1433. Finally, selection of the transport method, including protocol versions, is important when selecting secure protocols. Downgrade attacks and simply using insecure versions of protocols can lead to data exposures, so selecting and requiring appropriate versions of protocols like TLS is an important configuration decision."

A FEC for voice or video would use low-latency paths to ensure real-time traffic delivery. Email would operate in a best effort class since it is less susceptible to delays and higher latency.

Network segmentation divides a network into logical or physical groupings that are frequently based on trust boundaries, functional requirements, or other reasons that help an organization apply controls or assist with functionality. A number of technologies and concepts are used for segmentation, but one of the most common is the use of virtual local area networks (VLANs). A VLAN sets up a broadcast domain that is segmented at the Data Link layer. Switches or other devices are used to create a VLAN using VLAN tags, allowing different ports across multiple network devices like switches to all be part of the same VLAN without other systems plugged into those switches being in the same broadcast domain.",
      "A broadcast domain is a segment of a network in which all the devices or systems can reach one another via packets sent as a broadcast at the Data Link layer. Broadcasts are sent to all machines on a network, so limiting the broadcast domain makes networks less noisy by limiting the number of devices that are able to broadcast to one another. Broadcasts don't cross boundaries between networks—if your computer sends a broadcast, only those systems in the same broadcast domain will see it.",

That's where network access control (NAC), sometimes called network admissions control, comes in. NAC technologies focus on determining whether a system or device should be allowed to connect to a network. If it passes the requirements set for admission, NAC places it into an appropriate zone.",
      "To accomplish this task, NAC can use a software agent that is installed on the computer to perform security checks. Or the process may be agentless and run from a browser or by another means without installing software locally. Capabilities vary, and software agents typically have a greater ability to determine the security state of a machine by validating patch levels, security settings, antivirus versions, and other settings and details before admitting a system to the network. Some NAC solutions also track user behavior, allowing for systems to be removed from the network if they engage in suspect behaviors.",
      "Since NAC has the ability to validate security status for systems, it can be an effective policy enforcement tool. If a system does not meet security objectives, or if it has an issue, the system can be placed into a quarantine network. There the system can be remediated and rechecked, or it can simply be prohibited from connecting to the network.",
      "NAC checks can occur before a device is allowed on the network (preadmission) or after it has connected (postadmission). The combination of agent or agentless solutions and pre- or postadmission designs is driven by security objectives and the technical capabilities of an organization's selected tool. Agent-based NAC requires installation and thus adds complexity and maintenance, but it provides greater insight and control. Agentless installations are lightweight and easier to handle for users whose machines may not be centrally managed or who have devices that may not support the NAC agent. However, agentless installations provide less detail. Preadmission NAC decisions keep potentially dangerous systems off a network; postadmission decisions can help with response and prevent failed NAC access attempts from stopping business.",

      "Protecting networks from devices that are connected to them requires more than just validating their security state using NAC. A number of protections focus on ensuring that the network itself is not endangered by traffic that is sent on it.",
      "Port security is a capability that allows you to limit the number of MAC addresses that can be used on a single port. This prevents a number of possible problems, including MAC (hardware) address spoofing, content-addressable memory (CAM) table overflows, and in some cases, plugging in additional network devices to extend the network. Although port security implementations vary, most port security capabilities allow you to either dynamically lock the port by setting a maximum number of MAC addresses or statically lock the port to allow only specific MAC addresses. Although this type of MAC filtering is less nuanced and provides less information than NAC does, it remains useful.",
      "Port security was originally a term used for Cisco switches, but many practitioners and vendors use it to describe similar features found on switches from other companies as well.",
      "Port security helps protect the CAM table, which maps MAC addresses to IP addresses, allowing a switch to send traffic to the correct port. If the CAM table doesn't have an entry, the switch will attempt to determine what port the address is on, broadcasting traffic to all ports if necessary. That means attackers who can fill a CAM table can make switches fail over to broadcasting traffic, making otherwise inaccessible traffic visible on their local port.",
      "Since spoofing MAC addresses is relatively easy, port security shouldn't be relied on to prevent untrusted systems from connecting. Despite this, configuring port security can help prevent attackers from easily connecting to a network if NAC is not available or not in use. It can also prevent CAM table overflow attacks that might otherwise be possible.",
      "In addition to port security, protocol-level protections are an important security capability that switches and other network devices provide. These include the following:",
      "Loop prevention focuses on detecting loops and then disabling ports to prevent the loops from causing issues. Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), using bridge protocol data units, as well as anti-loop implementations like Cisco's loopback detection capability, sends frames with a switch identifier that the switch then monitors to prevent loops. Although a loop can be as simple as a cable with both ends plugged into the same switch, loops can also result from cables plugged into different switches, firewalls that are plugged in backward, devices with several network cards plugged into different portions of the same network, and other misconfigurations found in a network.",
      "Broadcast storm prevention, sometimes called storm control, prevents broadcast packets from being amplified as they traverse a network. Preventing broadcast storms relies on several features, such as offering loop protection on ports that will be connected to user devices, enabling STP on switches to make sure that loops are detected and disabled, and rate-limiting broadcast traffic. A broadcast storm occurs when a loop in a network causes traffic amplification to occur as switches attempt to figure out where traffic should be sent. The following graphic shows a loop with three switches, A, B, and C, all connected together. Since traffic from host 1 could be coming through either switch B or switch C, when a broadcast is sent out asking where host 1 is, multiple responses will occur. When this occurs, responses will be sent from both switches B and C. As this repeats, amplification will occur, causing a storm.",
      "Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) Guard protects STP by preventing ports that should not send BPDU messages from sending them. It is typically applied to switch ports where user devices and servers will be plugged in. Ports where switches will be connected will not have BPDU Guard turned on, because they may need to send BPDU messages that provide information about ports, addresses, priorities, and costs as part of the underlying management and control of the network.",
      "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) snooping focuses on preventing rogue DHCP servers from handing out IP addresses to clients in a managed network. DHCP snooping drops messages from any DHCP server that is not on a list of trusted servers, but it can also be configured with additional options such as the ability to block DHCP messages where the source MAC and the hardware MAC of a network card do not match. A final security option is to drop messages releasing or declining a DHCP offer if the release or decline does not come from the same port that the request came from, preventing attackers from causing a DHCP offer or renewal to fail.",
      "These protections may seem like obvious choices, but network administrators need to balance the administrative cost and time to implement them for each port in a network, as well as the potential for unexpected impacts if security settings affect services. Implementation choices must take into account whether attacks are likely, how controlled the network segment or access to network ports is, and how difficult it will be to manage all the network ports that must be configured and maintained. Central network management tools as well as dynamic and rules-based management capabilities can reduce the time needed for maintenance and configuration, but effort will still be required for initial setup and ongoing support."

SSL VPNs are popular because they can be used without a client installed or specific endpoint configuration that is normally required for IPSec VPNs.

Since site-to-site VPNs are typically used to extend an organization's network, they are frequently always-on VPNs, meaning that they are connected and available all of the time, and that if they experience a failure they will automatically attempt to reconnect.

They are commonly used for web service infrastructures, but other types of load balancers can also be found in use throughout many networks. Load balancers typically present a virtual IP (VIP), which clients send service requests to on a service port. The load balancer then distributes those requests to servers in a pool or group.",

      "Active/active load balancer designs distribute the load among multiple systems that are online and in use at the same time.",
      "Active/passive load balancer designs bring backup or secondary systems online when an active system is removed or fails to respond properly to a health check. This type of environment is more likely to be found as part of disaster recovery or business continuity environments, and it may offer less capability from the passive system to ensure some functionality remains.",
      "Load balancers rely on a variety of scheduling or load-balancing algorithms to choose where traffic is sent to. Here are a few of the most common options:",

      "Least connection sends traffic to the server with the fewest number of active connections.",
      "Agent-based adaptive balancing monitors the load and other factors that impact a server's ability to respond and updates the load balancer's traffic distribution based on the agent's reports.",
      "Source IP hashing uses a hash of the source IP to assign traffic to servers. This is essentially a randomization algorithm using client-driven input.",
      "In addition to these, weighted algorithms take into account a weighting or score. Weighted algorithms include the following:",
      "Weighted least connection uses a least connection algorithm combined with a predetermined weight value for each server.",
      "Fixed weighted relies on a preassigned weight for each server, often based on capability or capacity.",
      "Weighted response time combines the server's current response time with a weight value to assign it traffic.",
      "Finally, load balancers may need to establish persistent sessions. Persistence means that a client and a server continue to communicate throughout the duration of a session. This helps servers provide a smoother experience, with consistent information maintained about the client, rather than requiring that the entire load-balanced pool be made aware of the client's session. Of course, sticky sessions also mean that load will remain on the server that the session started with, which requires caution in case too many long-running sessions run on a single server and a load-balancing algorithm is in use that doesn't watch this.",
      "Factors such as the use of persistence, different server capabilities, or the use of scalable architectures can all drive choices for scheduling algorithms. Tracking server utilization by a method such as an agent-based adaptive balancing algorithm can be attractive but requires more infrastructure and overhead than a simple round-robin algorithm."

It also creates a potential point of failure since an inline device that stops working may cause an outage. Some inline devices are equipped with features that can allow them to fail open instead of failing closed, but not all failure scenarios will activate this feature!",

Taps don't provide the same ability to interact with traffic but also avoid the problem of potential failures of a device causing an outage. Taps are commonly used to allow for monitoring, analysis, and security purposes.",

This means that power outages or software failures can interrupt traffic. Passive taps have a direct path between network ports. Passive optical taps simply split the light passing through them to create copies. Passive taps for copper networks do require power but have a direct path, meaning that a power outage will not interrupt traffic.",
      "The Security+ exam outline doesn't mention a common third option: a SPAN port or mirror port, which is a feature built into routers and switches that allows selected traffic to be copied to a designated port. SPAN ports work similarly to taps but may be impacted by traffic levels on the switch and are typically considered less secure because they can be impacted by switch and router vulnerabilities and configuration issues, unlike a passive tap that simply copies traffic."

      "There are two basic types of firewalls:",
      "Stateless firewalls (sometimes called packet filters) filter every packet based on data such as the source and destination IP and port, the protocol, and other information that can be gleaned from the packet's headers. They are the most basic type of firewall.",
      "Stateful firewalls (sometimes called dynamic packet filters) pay attention to the state of traffic between systems. They can make a decision about a conversation and allow it to continue once it has been approved rather than reviewing every packet. They track this information in a state table, and use the information they gather to allow them to see entire traffic flows instead of each packet, providing them with more context to make security decisions.",
      "Along with stateful and stateless firewalls, additional terms are used to describe some firewall technologies. Next-generation firewall (NGFW) devices are far more than simple firewalls. In fact, they might be more accurately described as all-in-one network security devices in many cases. The general term has been used to describe network security devices that include a range of capabilities such as deep packet inspection, IDS/IPS functionality, antivirus and antimalware, and other functions. Despite the overlap between NGFWs and UTM devices, NGFWs are typically faster and capable of more throughput because they are more focused devices.",
      "Unified threat management (UTM) devices frequently include firewall, IDS/IPS, antimalware, URL and email filtering and security, data loss prevention, VPN, and security monitoring and analytics capabilities. The line between UTM and NGFW devices can be confusing, and the market continues to narrow the gaps between devices as each side offers additional features. UTM devices are typically used for an “out of box” solution where they can be quickly deployed and used, often for small to mid-sized organizations. NGFWs typically require more configuration and expertise.",
      "UTM appliances are frequently deployed at network boundaries, particularly for an entire organization or division. Since they have a wide range of security functionality, they can replace several security devices while providing a single interface to manage and monitor them. They also typically provide a management capability that can handle multiple UTM devices at once, allowing organizations with several sites or divisions to deploy UTM appliances to protect each area while still managing and monitoring them centrally.",
      "Finally, web application firewalls (WAFs) are security devices that are designed to intercept, analyze, and apply rules to web traffic, including tools such as database queries, APIs, and other web application tools. In many ways, a WAF is easier to understand if you think of it as a firewall combined with an intrusion prevention system. They provide deeper inspection of the traffic sent to web servers looking for attacks and attack patterns, and then apply rules based on what they see. This allows them to block attacks in real time, or even modify traffic sent to web servers to remove potentially dangerous elements in a query or request.",
      "Regardless of the type of firewall, common elements include the use of firewall rules that determine what traffic is allowed and what traffic is stopped. While rule syntax may vary, an example firewall rule will typically include the source, including IP addresses, hostnames, or domains, ports and protocols, an allow or deny statement, and destination IP addresses, host or hosts, or domain with ports and protocols. Rules may read:",

      "The Security+ exam outline also calls out one other specific use of firewalls: the creation of screened subnets. A screened subnet like the example shown in Figure 12.3 uses three interfaces on a firewall. One interface is used to connect to the Internet or an untrusted network, one is used to create a secured area, and one is used to create a public area (sometimes called a DMZ)."

Honeypots are systems that are intentionally configured to appear to be vulnerable but that are actually heavily instrumented and monitored systems that will document everything an attacker does while retaining copies of every file and command they use. They appear to be legitimate and may have tempting false information available on them. Much like honeypots, honeynets are networks set up and instrumented to collect information about network attacks. In essence, a honeynet is a group of honeypots set up to be even more convincing and to provide greater detail on attacker tools due to the variety of systems and techniques required to make it through the network of systems.",
      "Unlike honeynets and honeypots, which are used for adversarial research, honeyfiles are used for intrusion detection. A honeyfile is an intentionally attractive file that contains unique, detectable data that is left in an area that an attacker is likely to visit if they succeed in their attacks. If the data contained in a honeyfile is detected leaving the network, or is later discovered outside of the network, the organization knows that the system was breached.",
      "Honeytokens are the final item in this category. Honeytokens are data that is intended to be attractive to attackers but which is used specifically to allow security professionals to track data. They may be entries in databases, files, directories, or any other data asset that can be specifically identified. IDS, IPS, DLP, and other systems are then configured to watch for honeytokens that should not be sent outside the organization or accessed under normal circumstances because they are not actual organizational data. If they are in use or being transferred, it is likely that a malicious attacker has accessed them, thinking that they have legitimate and valuable data.",

Using DMARC, you can choose to reject or quarantine messages that are not sent by a DMARC-supporting sender. You can read an overview of DMARC at http://dmarc.org/overview.",
      "If you want to see an example of a DMARC record, you can check out the DMARC information for SendGrid by using a dig command from a Linux command prompt: dig txt _dmarc.sendgrid.net. Note that it is critical to include the underscore before _dmarc. You should see something that looks like the following graphic.",
      "If you do choose to implement DMARC, you should set it up with the none flag for policies and review your data reports before going further to make sure you won't be inadvertently blocking important email. Although many major email services are already using DMARC, smaller providers and organizations may not be.",
      "In addition to email security frameworks like DKIM, SPF, and DMARC, email security devices are used by many organizations. These devices, often called email security gateways, are designed to filter both inbound and outbound email while providing a variety of security services. They typically include functions like phishing protection, email encryption, attachment sandboxing to counter malware, ransomware protection functions, URL analysis and threat feed integration, and of course support for DKIM, SPF, and DMARC checking.",

Unlike IPv4 networks where ICMP may be blocked by default, IPv6 relies far more heavily on ICMP, meaning that habitual security practices are a bad idea. The use of NAT in IPv4 networks is also no longer needed due to the IPv6 address space, meaning that the protection that NAT provides for some systems will no longer exist.

      "Routing and switching protocol security can be complex, with protocols like Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) lacking built-in security features. Therefore, attacks such as BGP hijacking attacks and other routing attacks remain possible. Organizations cannot rely on a secure protocol in many cases and need to design around this lack.",

Redirects to secure websites are also a popular target for attackers since unencrypted requests for the HTTP version of a site could be redirected to a site of the attacker's choosing to allow for an on-path attack. The HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) security policy mechanism is intended to prevent attacks like these that rely on protocol downgrades and cookie jacking by forcing browsers to connect only via HTTPS using TLS. Unfortunately, HSTS only works after a user has visited the site at least once, allowing attackers to continue to leverage on-path attacks.",

The Trojan is then able to access and modify information sent and received by the browser. Since the browser receives and decrypts information, a browser-based on-path attack can successfully bypass TLS encryption and other browser security features, and it can also access sites with open sessions or that the browser is authenticated to, allowing a browser-based on-path attack to be a very powerful option for an attacker. Since browser-based on-path attacks require a Trojan to be installed, either as a browser plug-in or a proxy, system-level security defenses like antimalware tools and system configuration management and monitoring capabilities are best suited to preventing them.",

DNS cache poisoning may be noticed by users or may be detected by network defenses like an IDS or IPS, but it can be difficult to detect if done well.",
      "DNSSEC can help prevent DNS poisoning and other DNS attacks by validating both the origin of DNS information and ensuring that the DNS responses have not been modified. You can read more about DNSSEC at www.icann.org/resources/pages/dnssec-what-is-it-why-important-2019-03-05-en.",
      "When domain hijacking isn't possible and DNS cannot be poisoned, another option for attackers is URL redirection. URL redirection can take many forms, depending on the vulnerability that attackers leverage, but one of the most common is to insert alternate IP addresses into a system's hosts file. The hosts file is checked when a system looks up a site via DNS and will be used first, making a modified hosts file a powerful tool for attackers who can change it. Modified hosts files can be manually checked, or they can be monitored by system security antimalware tools that know the hosts file is a common target. In most organizations, the hosts file for the majority of machines will never be modified from its default, making changes easy to spot.",
      "Although DNS attacks can provide malicious actors with a way to attack your organization, you can also leverage DNS-related information to help defend against attacks. Domain reputation services and tools provide information about whether a domain is a trusted email sender or sends a lot of spam email. In addition, individual organizations may assign domain reputation scores for email senders using their own email security and antispam tools.",
      "Figure 12.5 shows an example of the Cisco Talos email reputation service. As you would expect, Gmail has a favorable reputation, but you'll also note that the default display shows service in India for the location. Automated systems may not always have completely accurate data, particularly with complex, multinational services like Gmail.",
      "FIGURE 12.5 Reputation data for gmail.com",
      "Other services like McAfee's WebWasher and SmartFilter databases provide other views of IP addresses and websites, allowing granular reputational views based on recent actions and activity. When you consider network-based controls and defenses, you should think about how reputation as a broad concept may be useful for defense, and how you and your organization would respond if an incident caused your reputation score to drop and be listed as negative or malicious by one, or many, services.",

      "One of the most common forms of the distributed denial-of-service attack is a network-based DDoS. Malicious actors commonly use large-scale botnets to conduct network DDoS attacks, and commercial services exist that conduct DDoS attacks and DDoS-like behavior for stress- and load-testing purposes. All of this means that organizations need to have a plan in place to detect and handle network DDoS attacks.",
      "In many cases, your organization's Internet service provider (ISP) may provide a DDoS prevention service, either by default or as an additional subscription option. Knowing whether your ISP provides the capability and under what circumstances it will activate or can be turned on can be a critical network defense for your organization. If your ISP does not provide DDoS prevention, a second option is to ensure that your network border security devices have DDoS prevention capabilities.",
      "Once you understand your defensive capabilities, you need to know the most common types of network DDoS attacks. Although there are many types, they can be categorized into two major categories: volume-based and protocol-based.",
      "Volume-based network DDoS attacks focus on the sheer amount of traffic causing a denial-of-service condition. Some volume-based DDoS attacks rely on amplification techniques that leverage flaws or features in protocols and services to create significantly more traffic than the attacker sends. Volume-based attack examples include UDP and ICMP floods:",
      "UDP floods take advantage of the fact that UDP doesn't use a three-way handshake like TCP does, allowing UDP floods to be executed simply by sending massive amounts of traffic that the target host will receive and attempt to process. Since UDP is not rate limited or otherwise protected and does not use a handshake, UDP floods can be conducted with minimal resources on the attacking systems. UDP floods can be detected using IDSs and IPSs and other network defenses that have a UDP flood detection rule or module. Manual detection of a flood can be done with a packet analyzer as part of a response process, but manual analysis of a live attack can be challenging and may not be timely.",
      "Unlike UDP, ICMP is rate limited in many modern operating systems. ICMP floods, sometimes called ping floods, send massive numbers of ICMP packets, with each requesting a response. ICMP floods require more aggregate bandwidth on the side of the attacker than the defender has, which is why a distributed denial-of-service via ICMP may be attempted. Many organizations rate-limit or block ping at network ingress points to prevent this type of attack, and they may rate-limit ICMP between security zones as well. Much like UDP floods, detection rules on network security devices as well as manual detection can be used, but proactive defenses are relatively easy and quite common to deploy despite the fact that some ICMP traffic may be lost if the rate limit is hit.",
      "Protocol-based network DDoS attacks focus on the underlying protocols used for networking. SYN floods send the first step in a three-way handshake and do not respond to the SYN-ACK that is sent back, thus consuming TCP stack resources until they are exhausted. These attacks are one of the most common modern protocol-based network DDoS attacks. Older attacks targeted vulnerable TCP stacks with attacks like the Ping of Death, which sent a ping packet too large for many to handle, and Smurf attacks, which leveraged ICMP broadcast messages with a spoofed sender address, causing systems throughout the broadcast domain to send traffic to the purported sender and thus overwhelming it. Fragmented packets, packets with all of their TCP flags turned on (Christmas Tree or Xmas attacks), and a variety of other attacks have leveraged flaws and limitations in how the networking was implemented in operating systems. Security professionals need to know that the features of network protocols and the specific implementations of those protocols may be leveraged as part of an attack and that they may need to identify those attacks.",
      "Figure 12.6 shows a SYN flood as seen via Wireshark with appropriate filters turned on. Identifying a SYN DDoS will typically mean reviewing traffic aimed at a target host and noticing that there are massive numbers of SYN packets being sent without the rest of the handshake being completed by the requestors. Note that in this figure, a single system is sending the SYN flood; in a real DDoS, several systems would be shown as the source of the traffic. Filtering by the destination system and ensuring that three-way handshakes were not completed would be required to validate a DDoS attack.",
      "FIGURE 12.6 A SYN flood shown in Wireshark",
      "The Security+ exam outline specifically calls out one type of volume-based denial-of-service attack: amplified denial-of-service attacks. Amplified denial-of-service attacks take advantage of protocols that allow a small query to return large results like a DNS query. Spoofing a system's IP address as part of a query can result in a DNS server sending much more traffic to the spoofed IP address than was sent to the DNS server originally, amplifying a small amount of traffic into a large response.",
      "This type of attack also takes advantage of the other type of denial-of-service attack specifically mentioned in the exam outline: reflected denial-of-service attacks. The spoofed IP address causes a legitimate service to conduct the attack, making it harder to know who the attacker is. When combined into a reflected and amplified denial-of-service attack, this can be a powerful combination that is difficult to stop and even more difficult to track down."

      "Security professionals need to understand how secure networks are designed. Infrastructure considerations that security professionals must take into account include the organization's attack surface, where devices are logically and physically placed, and how security zones will be established based on organizational requirements. Then, connectivity requirements, including speed and latency, need to be accounted for and failure modes, including if devices should fail open to maintain access or fail closed to ensure security, should be determined. Concepts like physical isolation and air-gapping and logical segmentation help create barriers to attacks and exploits. High-availability design concepts ensure that systems remain online despite issues or disasters. Secure protocols are used to keep data secure in transit.",
      "Modern networks also rely on the ability to be controlled by software as part of software-defined networks. SD-WANs (software-defined wide area networks) take this concept outside of the local organization to manage connectivity. SASE helps to protect devices regardless of their location since organizations often operate in more than one place. Finally, zero trust concepts move organizations from traditional layered defenses to a continuous validation and authorization model.",
      "Network access control (NAC), 802.1X, and port security all help control access to the network itself. Validating machines and their security stance can help ensure that only secure devices are allowed on the network. VPNs provide secure remote access and protect organizational data in transit by tunneling through other, untrusted networks.",
      "Many of the security tools are available as security appliances and devices. Secure access via jump boxes lets administrators safely cross security boundaries. Load balancers, proxy servers, and web filters provide network capabilities, whereas firewalls, IDS and IPS devices, and DLP tools provide focused security functionality. Security and device management design options include out-of-band management techniques, access control lists, quality-of-service functionality, routing protocol security options, DNS security configurations, broad use of TLS and TLS-enabled services, SNMP and monitoring tools, and even tools used to capture and analyze attacker tools and techniques like honeynets and honeypots. Regardless of the type of network device, it should be hardened as part of its configuration process.",
      "Using secure protocols and services instead of insecure versions and understanding the limitations and implementation requirements for each protocol and service is also important. Once attackers are in a network, they will attempt to gain access to network traffic, and secure protocols will help ensure that traffic an attacker intercepts will not be easily accessible to them. Options like secure email, FTP, HTTP, and Secure Shell are all part of the secure network design toolkit.",
      "Even with all of these defenses in place, you need to be able to identify a number of attacks: on-path attacks, DNS, credential replay, and distributed denial-of-service attacks. Each of these attacks has identifiable characteristics, ranging from traffic patterns to switch behavior."

      "The foundation of network security is a secure design. Networks must be designed with security in mind. Considerations include the attack surface of the network and its attached devices, which drives placement and segmentation into different security zones based on risk or security requirements. Understanding what will happen when failures occur and dealing with those failures also influences design and choices around high availability. NAC and 802.1X protect networks from untrusted devices being connected, whereas port security and port-level protections like loop prevention and broadcast storm protection ensure that malicious or misconfigured systems do not cause network issues. Network taps and monitoring ports allow packet capture by creating a copy of traffic from other ports. VPNs are used to tunnel network traffic to another location, and they can be encrypted or simply tunneled. Key concepts like physical isolation, logical segmentation, use of secure protocols, use of reputation services, and tools like software-defined networking, zero trust, SD-WAN, and SASE all have their place in secure network design.",
      "Network appliances are used to provide security services to networks and systems. There are many types of network appliances. Jump servers provide a secure way to access systems in another security zone. Load balancers spread load among systems and can use different scheduling options as well as operational modes like active/active or active/passive designs. Proxy servers either centralize connections from a group of clients out to a server or from a group of servers out to clients, often as a load-balancing strategy. Web filters filter content and URLs to limit what information can enter and exit a network based on rules, and data loss prevention systems monitor to ensure that data that shouldn't leave systems or networks is identified and flagged, sent securely, or stopped. IDS and IPS devices identify and take action based on malicious behavior, signatures, or anomalies in traffic. Data collection devices like sensors and collectors help with data gathering. Firewalls, including next-generation firewalls, web application firewalls, and unified threat management appliances, are used to build security zones and are placed at trust boundaries. UTM devices combine many of these security features and capabilities into a single appliance or system. Access control lists are used by many devices, including switches and routers to determine what traffic can flow through them based on rules.",
      "Network security services and management techniques help make sure that a network stays secure. Out-of-band management puts management interfaces on a separate VLAN or physical network or requires direct connection to help prevent attackers from gaining access to management interfaces. DNS security is also limited, but DNSSEC helps validate DNS servers and responses. DNS servers must be properly configured to prevent zone transfers and other DNS attacks. Email security leverages DMARC, DKIM, and SPF to validate senders and domains. TLS is used broadly to protect network traffic, acting as a wrapper for many other protocols. Monitoring services and systems helps ensure that they remain online and accessible but require care due to the amount of information that can be generated and the fact that false positives are possible if the validation and monitoring does not fully validate service responses. File integrity monitors check to see if files have been changed and can alert on changes or restore existing files to a pre-change or pre-deletion state. Honeypots and honeynets are used to gather information about attackers, and honeyfiles and honeytokens are used to identify potential breaches and attackers who have gathered information from systems in your environment. Network devices are hardened, much like other devices, often based on standards and benchmarks.",
      "Secure protocols provide ways to send and receive information securely. Many original Internet protocols are not secure—they do not provide encryption or authentication and can be captured and analyzed or modified. Using secure versions of protocols or using an alternate secure service and protocol is an important part of ensuring that a network is secure. Key protocols include voice and video protocols like SRTP; email protocols like IMAPS and POPS; and security protocols like DMARC, DKIM, and SPF. File transfers can be done via SFTP or FTPS instead of FTP, and directory services can be moved from LDAP to LDAPS. Some protocols do not have as many or as complete secure options. In fact, DNS, routing, and DHCP all have limited options for secure communications. Network administrators must take these into account while designing and operating their networks.",
      "Network attacks drive network security decisions and design. On-path attacks redirect traffic through a system that an attacker controls, allowing them to observe and potentially modify traffic. DNS attacks include domain hijacking, DNS poisoning, and URL redirection, but can be partially countered through the use of DNSSEC. Credential replay attacks take advantage of poorly designed or insecure protocols to send valid authentication hashes or other artifacts pretending to be a legitimate user. Malicious code ranging from worms to denial-of-service tools can impact networks and must be accounted for in design. Denial-of-service attacks and distributed denial-of-service attacks consume resources or target services to cause them to fail. Reflected denial-of-service attacks use spoofed source addresses to cause traffic to be sent to targets, whereas amplified denial-of-service attacks use small queries to get large results, amplifying their impact."

Bluetooth is primarily used for low-power, short-range (less than 100 meters and typically 5–30 meters) connections that do not have very high bandwidth needs. Bluetooth devices are usually connected in a point-to-point rather than a client-server model. A typical Bluetooth connection is done by pairing, a process that searches for devices that are looking to connect. Once you connect, you may be asked for a PIN to validate the connection.",

RFID may be deployed using active tags, which have their own power source and always send signals to be read by a reader; semi-active tags, which have a battery to power their circuits but are activated by the reader; or passive tags, which are entirely powered by the reader.",
      "RFID tags also use one of three frequency ranges. Low-frequency RFIDs are used for short-range, low-power tags and are commonly used for entry access and identification purposes, where they are scanned by a nearby reader. Low-frequency RFID is not consistent around the world, meaning that tags may not meet frequency or power requirements in other countries. High-frequency RFID tags have a longer readable range at up to a meter under normal circumstances and can communicate more quickly. In fact, high-frequency RFID is used for near-field communication, and many tags support read-only, write-only, and rewritable tags. The final frequency range is ultra-high-frequency RFID, the fastest to read and with the longest range. This means that ultra-high-frequency RFID tags are used in circumstances where readers need to be farther away. High-frequency tags have found broad implementation for inventory and antitheft purposes as well as a multitude of other uses where a tag that can be remotely queried from meters away can be useful.",
      "Because of their small size and flexible form factor, RFID tags can be embedded in stickers, small implantable chips like those used to identify pets, and in the form of devices like tollway tags. RFID tags can be attacked in a multitude of ways, from simple destruction or damage of the tag so that it cannot be read to modification of tags, some of which can be reprogrammed. Tags can be cloned, modified, or spoofed; readers can be impersonated; and traffic can be captured."

In 2008, in California they discovered that the RFID tags used for the toll road system had not been locked after they were written, meaning that tags could be read and reprogrammed, changing the transponder ID. Since the RFID tag could be rewritten at a distance, this opened up a wide number of potential attacks. If this vulnerability was used for malicious purposes, it would have been possible for attackers to rewrite transponders, charge tolls to other vehicles, and otherwise wreak havoc on the toll system.

Many wireless attacks work better if the target system can be forced to disassociate from the access point that it is using when the attack starts.

When the AP receives it, it will disassociate the device, requiring it to then reconnect to continue. Since management frames for networks that are using WPA2 are often not encrypted, this type of attack is relatively easy to conduct. WPA3, however, requires protected management frames and will prevent this type of deauthentication attack from working.",

Tuning and placement are critical, because wireless access points have a limited number of channels to operate within, and multiple wireless access points using the same channel within range of each other can decrease the performance and overall usability of the network. At the same time, organizations typically don't want to extend signal to places where they don't intend their network to reach. That means your design may need to include AP placement options that limit how far wireless signal extends beyond your buildings or corporate premises.",
      "An important part of designing a wireless network is to conduct a site survey. Site surveys involve moving throughout the entire facility or space to determine what existing networks are in place and to look at the physical structure for the location options for your access points. In new construction, network design is often included in the overall design for the facility. Since most deployments are in existing structures, however, walking through a site to conduct a survey is critical.",
      "Site survey tools test wireless signal strength as you walk, allowing you to match location using GPS and physically marking your position on a floorplan or map as you go. They then show where wireless signal is, how strong it is, and what channel or channels each access point or device is on in the form of a heatmap. Figure 13.3 shows an example of a heatmap for a building. Note that access points have a high signal area that drops off and that the heat maps aren't perfect circles. The building's construction and interference from other devices can influence how the wireless signal behaves.",
      "FIGURE 13.3 A wireless heatmap showing the wireless signal available from an access point",
      "Determining which channels your access points will use is also part of this process. In the 2.4 GHz band, each channel is 20 MHz wide, with a 5 MHz space between. There are 11 channels for 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi deployments, resulting in overlap between channels in the 70 MHz of space allocated, as shown in Figure 13.3. In most uses, this means that channels 1, 6, and 11 are used when it is possible to control channel usage in a space to ensure that there is no overlap and thus interference between channels. In dense urban areas or areas where other organizations may have existing Wi-Fi deployments, overlapping the channels in use onto your heatmap will help determine what channel each access point should use.",
      "Figure 13.4 shows the 2.4 GHz channels in use in North America. Additional channels are available in Japan, Indonesia, and outside of the United States, with those areas supporting channels 12 and 13 in addition to the 11 channels U.S. networks use. Note the overlap between the channels, which can cause interference if access points use overlapping channels within reach of each other.",

Wireless network management software can monitor for interference and overlap problems and adjust your network using the same capabilities that they use to determine if there are new rogue access points or other unexpected wireless devices in their coverage area. These more advanced enterprise Wi-Fi controllers and management tools can also adjust broadcast power to avoid interference or even to overpower an unwanted device.",
      "Figuring out what access points and other devices are already in place and what networks may already be accessible in a building or space that you intend to deploy a wireless network into can be a challenge. Fortunately, Wi-Fi analyzer software is used to gather all the data you need to survey and plan networks, create heatmaps, identify the best channel mapping to use in 2D and 3D models, conduct speed tests, and perform wireless client information, among other tasks. Although each analyzer tool may have different functionality and features, they are a critical part of the toolkit that network engineers and security professionals use to assess wireless networks."

In addition, monitoring and logging should be turned on and tuned to ensure that important information and events are logged both to the wireless controller or access point and to central management software or systems.",
      "More advanced WLAN controllers and access points may also have advanced security features, such as threat intelligence, intrusion prevention, or other capabilities integrated into them. Depending on your network architecture and security design, you may want to leverage these capabilities, or you may choose to disable them because your network infrastructure implements those capabilities in another location or with another tool, or they do not match the needs of the network where you have them deployed."

      "WPA2-Enterprise relies on a RADIUS authentication server as part of an 802.1X implementation for authentication. Users can thus have unique credentials and be individually identified.",
      "WPA2 introduced the use of the Counter Mode Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP). CCMP uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption to provide confidentiality, delivering much stronger encryption than older protocols like the Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) protocol, which was used prior to WPA2. In addition to confidentiality, CCMP provides authentication for the user and access control capabilities. You'll note that user authentication is provided but not network authentication—that is an important addition in WPA3.",
      "Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3), the replacement for WPA2, has been required to be supported in all Wi-Fi devices since the middle of 2020. WPA3 deployments are increasingly common as WPA3 supplants WPA2 in common usage. WPA3 improves on WPA2 in a number of ways depending on whether it is used in Personal or Enterprise mode. WPA3-Personal provides additional protection for password-based authentication, using a process known as Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE). SAE replaces the pre-shared keys used in WPA2 and requires interaction between both the client and the network to validate both sides. That interaction slows down brute-force attacks and makes them less likely to succeed. WPA3-Personal also implements perfect forward secrecy, which ensures that the traffic sent between the client and network is secure even if the client's password has been compromised."

      "WPA3-Enterprise provides stronger encryption than WPA2, with an optional 192-bit security mode, and adds authenticated encryption and additional controls for deriving and authenticating keys and encrypting network frames. WPA3 thus offers numerous security advantages over existing WPA2 networks.",
      "As WPA3 slowly expands in usage, it is important to note the security improvements it brings. WPA3-Personal replaces the WPA2-PSK authentication mode SAE (simultaneous authentication of equals) and implements perfect forward secrecy to keep traffic secure. WPA3-Enterprise continues to use RADIUS but improves the encryption and key management features built into the protocol, and provides greater protection for wireless frames. Open Wi-Fi networks also get an upgrade with the Wi-Fi Enhanced Open certification, which uses opportunistic wireless encryption (OWE) to provide encrypted Wi-Fi on open networks when possible—a major upgrade from the unencrypted open networks used with WPA2."

EAP-FAST is focused on providing faster reauthentication while devices are roaming. EAP-FAST works around the public key exchanges that slow down PEAP and EAP-TLS by using a shared secret (symmetric) key for reauthentication. EAP-FAST can use either preshared keys or dynamic keys established using public key authentication.",
      "EAP-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) implements certificate-based authentication as well as mutual authentication of the device and network. It uses certificates on both client and network devices to generate keys that are then used for communication. EAP-TLS is used less frequently due to the certificate management challenges for deploying and managing certificates on large numbers of client devices.",
      "EAP-Tunneled Transport Layer Security (EAP-TTLS) extends EAP-TLS, and unlike EAP-TLS, it does not require that client devices have a certificate to create a secure session. This removes the overhead and management effort that EAP-TLS requires to distribute and manage endpoint certificates while still providing TLS support for devices. A concern for EAP-TTLS deployments is that EAP-TTLS can require additional software to be installed on some devices, whereas PEAP, which provides similar functionality, does not. EAP-TTLS does provide support for some less secure authentication mechanisms, meaning that there are times where it may be implemented due to specific requirements.",
      "When organizations want to work together, RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service) servers can be federated to allow individuals from other organizations to authenticate to remote networks using their home organization's accounts and credentials. Federating RADIUS servers like this requires trust to be established between the RADIUS servers as part of a federation. Many higher education institutions provide a federated authentication service for wireless called eduroam, which allows students, faculty, and staff from any eduroam institution (https://eduroam.org) to authenticate and use the networks at any other eduroam supporting organization. Of course, RADIUS servers can be federated in a single organization as well if there are multiple RADIUS domains."

      "When organizations use mobile devices, one important design decision is the deployment and management model that will be selected. The most common options are BYOD, or bring your own device; CYOD, or choose your own device; COPE, or corporate-owned, personally enabled; and fully corporate owned.",
      "Each of these options has advantages and disadvantages, as outlined in Table 13.2.",
      "TABLE 13.2 Mobile device deployment and management options",
      "These options boil down to a few common questions. First, who owns, chooses, and pays for the device and its connectivity plans? Second, how is the device managed and supported? Third, how are data and applications managed, secured, and protected?",
      "BYOD places the control in the hands of the end user since they select and manage their own device. In some BYOD models, the organization may use limited management capabilities, such as the ability to remotely wipe email or specific applications, but BYOD's control and management model is heavily based on the user. This option provides far less security and oversight for the organization.",
      "In CYOD models, the organization pays for the device and typically for the cellular plan or other connectivity. The user selects the device, sometimes from a list of preferred options, rather than bringing whatever they would like to use. In a CYOD design of this type, support is easier since only a limited number of device types will be encountered, and that can make a security model easier to establish as well. Since CYOD continues to leave the device in the hands of the user, security and management is likely to remain less standardized, although this can vary.",
      "In a COPE model, the device is company-owned and -managed. COPE recognizes that users are unlikely to want to carry two phones and thus allows reasonable personal use on corporate devices. This model allows the organization to control the device more fully while still allowing personal use.",
      "A fully corporate-owned and -managed device is the most controlled environment and frequently more closely resembles corporate PCs with a complete control and management suite. This is the least user-friendly of the options since a corporate-chosen and -managed device will meet corporate needs but frequently lacks the flexibility of the more end user–centric designs.",
      "Although these are common descriptions, real-world implementations vary significantly, and the lines between each of these solutions can be blurry. Instead of hard-and-fast rules, these are examples of starting places for organizational mobile device deployment models and can help drive security, management, and operational practice discussions. The best way to look at these practices in real-world use is as part of a spectrum based on organizational needs, capabilities, and actual usage.",
      "There's one more acronym you are likely to encounter that the Security+ exam outline doesn't use: COBO, or company-owned business only. COBO is most frequently used to describe company-owned devices used only for business work. Devices used to scan tickets at events, tablets used by maintenance supervisors for work tracking, or inventory control devices all fit the COBO description. COBO doesn't leave a carve-out for personal use at all, so you should think of these as organization-purpose-specific mobile devices.",
      "One key technology that can help make mobile device deployments more secure is the use of virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) to allow relatively low-security devices to access a secured, managed environment. Using VDI allows device users to connect to the remote environment, perform actions, and then return to normal use of their device. Containerization tools can also help split devices between work and personal-use environments, allowing a work container or a personal container to be run on a device without mixing data and access."

    "paragraphs": [
      "Mobile devices can be a challenge to manage, particularly due to operating system limitations, variability between hardware manufacturers, carrier settings, and operating system versions. Many mobile devices are intended to be used by individuals and don't have the broad set of built-in controls that more business-oriented devices and software typically have. When you add in the wide variety of device deployment models, security practitioners face real challenges in an increasingly mobile device–focused environment.",
      "Thus, when administrators and security professionals need to manage mobile devices, they frequently turn to mobile device management (MDM) or unified endpoint management (UEM) tools. MDM tools specifically target devices like Android and iOS phones, tablets, and other similar systems. UEM tools combine mobile devices, desktops and laptops, and many other types of devices in a single management platform.",
      "Regardless of the type of tool you choose, there are a number of features your organization may use to ensure that your mobile devices and the data they contain are secure. Although the following list isn't a complete list of every feature available in MDM, UEM, and mobile application management (MAM) tools, you need to know about each of them, and why you might want to have it to be ready for the exam.",
      "Application management features are important to allow enterprise control of applications. These features may include deploying specific applications to all devices; limiting which applications can be installed; remotely adding, removing, or changing applications and settings for them; or monitoring application usage.",
      "Content management (sometimes called MCM, or mobile content management) ensures secure access and control of organizational files, including documents and media on mobile devices. A major concern for mobile device deployments is the combination of organizational data and personal data on BYOD and shared-use devices. Content management features lock away business data in a controlled space and then help manage access to that data. In many cases, this requires use of the MDM's application on the mobile device to access and use the data.",
      "Remote-wipe capabilities are used when a device is lost or stolen or when the owner is no longer employed by the organization. It is important to understand the difference between a full device wipe and wiping tools that can wipe only the organizational data and applications that have been deployed to the device. In environments where individuals own the devices, remote wipe can create liability and other issues if it is used and wipes the device. At the same time, remote wipe with a confirmation process that lets you know when it has succeeded is a big part of helping protect organizational data. Remote-wipe capabilities will work only if the device can receive the command to perform the wipe. This means that thieves and attackers who want to steal your data will immediately place the device in airplane mode or will isolate the phone using an RF-blocking bag or other container to ensure that the device can't send or receive Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or cellular signals. A smart attacker can prevent remote wipes and may be able to gain access to your data. That's when device encryption, strong passcodes, and the underlying security of the operating system become even more important.",
      "Geolocation and geofencing capabilities allow you to use the location of the phone to make decisions about its operation. Some organizations may only allow corporate tablets to be used inside corporate facilities to reduce the likelihood of theft or data access outside their buildings. Other organizations may want devices to wipe themselves if they leave a known area. Geolocation can also help locate lost devices, in addition to the many uses for geolocation that we are used to in our daily lives with mapping and similar tools.",
      "Screen locks, passwords, and PINs are all part of normal device security models to prevent unauthorized access. Screen lock time settings are one of the most frequently set security options for basic mobile device security. Much like desktops and laptops, mobile device management tools also set things like password length, complexity, and how often passwords or PINs must be changed.",
      "Biometrics are widely available on modern devices, with fingerprints and facial recognition the most broadly adopted and deployed. Biometrics can be integrated into mobile device management capabilities so that you can deploy biometric authentication for users to specific devices and leverage biometric factors for additional security or ease of use.",
      "Context-aware authentication goes beyond PINs, passwords, and biometrics to better reflect user behavior. Context may include things like location, hours of use, and a wide range of other behavioral elements that can determine whether a user should be able to log in.",
      "Containerization is an increasingly common solution to handling separation of work and personal-use contexts on devices. Using a secure container to run applications, store data, and otherwise keep the use of a device separate greatly reduces the risk of cross-contamination and exposure. In many MDM models, applications use wrappers to run them, helping keep them separate and secure. In others, a complete containerization environment is run as needed.",
      "Storage segmentation can be used to keep personal and business data separate as well. This may be separate volumes or even separate encrypted volumes that require specific applications, wrappers, or containers to access them. In fact, storage segmentation and containerization or wrapper technology are often combined to better implement application and separation.",
      "Full-device encryption (FDE) remains the best way to ensure that stolen or lost devices don't result in a data breach. When combined with remote-wipe capabilities and strong authentication requirements, FDE can provide the greatest chance of a device resisting data theft.",
      "Push notifications may seem like an odd inclusion here, but sending messages to devices can be useful in a number of scenarios. You may need to alert a user to an issue or ask them to perform an action. Or you may want to communicate with someone who found a lost device or tell a thief that the device is being tracked! Thus, having the ability to send messages from a central location can be a useful tool in an MDM or UEM system.",
      "UEM and MDM tools may also include features like per-application VPN to keep application data secure when that application is used, onboarding tools to help with BYOD environments, and advanced threat detection and response capabilities. Much like other classes of tools, the capabilities of MDM and UEM tools are continuing to overlap more and more every day, broadening the market but also making it more confusing. If you have to choose a tool in this space, it helps to focus on the specific requirements and features your organization needs and to choose your tool based on how those are implemented rather than the laundry list of features that many tools bring.",
      "MDM and UEM tools also provide a rich set of controls for user behaviors. They can enable closed or managed third-party application stores or limit what your users can download and use from the application stores that are native to the operating system or device you have deployed. They can also monitor for firmware updates and versions, including whether firmware over-the-air (OTA) updates have been applied to ensure that patching occurs.",
      "Of course, users may try to get around those controls by rooting their devices, or jailbreaking them so that they can sideload (manually install from a microSD card or via a USB cable) programs or even a custom firmware on the device. MDM and UEM tools will detect these activities by checking for known good firmware and software, and they can apply allow or block lists to the applications that the devices have installed.",
      "Controlling which services and device capabilities can be used, and even where they can be used, is also a feature that many organizations rely on. Limiting or prohibiting use of cameras and microphones as well as SMS, MMS, and rich communication services (RCS) messages can help prevent data leakage from secure areas. Limiting the use of external media and USB on-the-go (OTG) functionality that allows devices to act as hosts for USB external devices like cameras or storage can also help limit the potential for misuse of devices. MDM and UEM tools also typically allow administrators to control GPS tagging for photos and other documents that may be able to embed GPS data about where they were taken or created. The ability to use location data can be a useful privacy control or may be required by the organization as part of documentation processes.",
      "Some organizations, such as contractors for the U.S. Department of Defense ban cell phones with cameras from their facilities. Although buying a cell phone without a camera used to be easy, finding one now is very difficult. That's where MDM features that can block camera use can be handy. Although there may be workarounds, having a software package with the ability to block features like a camera may be an acceptable and handy control for some organizations.",
      "Administrators may also want to control how devices use their wireless connectivity. That can take the form of limiting which Wi-Fi networks devices can connect to, preventing them from forming or joining ad hoc wireless networks, and disabling tethering and the ability to become a wireless hotspot. Bluetooth and NFC controls can also help prevent the device from being used in ways that don't fit organizational security models, such as use as a payment method or access device."

These protocols provide for both simple authentication protocols, like WPA2's preshared key mode, and for enterprise authentication models that rely on RADIUS servers to provide user login with organizational credentials. Both rely on cryptographic protocols to encrypt data in transit.

That means you need to know how to detect and analyze an incident given a series of events or data points, how to contain the incident, and then what to do about it.",
      "In this chapter you'll learn about the components of a typical incident response process, including the incident response cycle. Incident response isn't just about how to stop an attacker or remove their tools. It includes preparation and learning processes to ensure that the organizations continuously learn and improve based on the incidents they have resolved. You'll also learn about incident response teams, the types of exercises you can conduct to get ready for incidents, and the incident response plans you may want to have in place.",
      "With the basics of incident response under your belt, your next step will be to examine threat detection and incident response data and tools and techniques. You'll explore indicators and data sources like logs that are commonly used to identify whether something has happened and what may have occurred. Along the way, you'll learn about common capabilities and uses for SIEM tools and NetFlow data, as well as the logs and data that SIEM systems ingest and analyze to help incident responders."

Whether that involves a direct attack by a malicious actor, malicious software, an insider threat, or even just a simple mistake, a security incident is an eventuality for all organizations.",
      "Organizations therefore need an incident response (IR) plan, process, and team, as well as the technology, skills, and training to respond appropriately. A strong incident response process is not just a one-time action or something that is applied only in emergencies. Instead, IR is an ongoing process that improves organizational security using information that is learned from each security incident.",
      "Although individual organizations may define them differently, in general an incident is a violation of the organization's policies and procedures or security practices. Events, on the other hand, are an observable occurrence, which means that there are many events, few of which are likely to be incidents. These definitions can become confusing, because IT service management standards define incidents differently, which means that some organizations specify security incidents to keep things straight."

      "The first step toward a mature incident response capability for most organizations is to understand the incident response process and what happens at each stage. Although organizations may use slightly different labels or steps and the number of steps may vary, the basic concepts remain the same. Organizations must prepare for incidents, identify incidents when they occur, and then contain and remove the artifacts of the incidents. Once the incident has been contained, the organization can work to recover and return to normal, and then make sure that the lessons learned from the incident are baked into the preparation for the next time something occurs.",
      "Figure 14.1 shows the six steps that the Security+ exam outline describes for the incident response process.",
      "FIGURE 14.1 The incident response cycle",
      "The six steps you will need to know for the Security+ exam are as follows:",
      "Preparation. In this phase, you build the tools, processes, and procedures to respond to an incident. That includes building and training an incident response team, conducting exercises, documenting what you will do and how you will respond, and acquiring, configuring, and operating security tools and incident response capabilities.",
      "Detection. This phase involves reviewing events to identify incidents. You must pay attention to indicators of compromise, use log analysis and security monitoring capabilities, and have a comprehensive awareness and reporting program for your staff.",
      "Analysis. Once an event has been identified as potentially being part of an incident, it needs to be analyzed. That includes identifying other related events and what their target or impact is or was.",
      "Containment. Once an incident has been identified, the incident response team needs to contain it to prevent further issues or damage. Containment can be challenging and may not be complete if elements of the incident are not identified in the initial identification efforts. This can involve quarantine, which places a system or device in an isolated network zone or removes it from a network to ensure that it cannot impact other devices.",
      "Eradication. The eradication stage involves removing the artifacts associated with the incident. In many cases, that will involve rebuilding or restoring systems and applications from backups rather than simply removing tools from a system since proving that a system has been fully cleaned can be very difficult. Complete eradication and verification is crucial to ensuring that an incident is over.",
      "Recovery. Restoration to normal is the heart of the recovery phase. That may mean bringing systems or services back online or other actions that are part of a return to operations. Recovery requires eradication to be successful, but it also involves implementing fixes to ensure that whatever security weakness, flaw, or action that allowed the incident to occur has been remediated to prevent the event from immediately reoccurring.",
      "In addition to these six steps, organizations typically conduct a lessons learned session. These sessions are important to ensure that organizations improve and do not make the same mistakes again. They may be as simple as patching systems or as complex as needing to redesign permission structures and operational procedures. Lessons learned are then used to inform the preparation process, and the cycle continues.",
      "Although this list may make it appear as if incidents always proceed in a linear fashion from item to item, many incidents will move back and forth between stages as additional discoveries are made or as additional actions are taken by malicious actors. So, you need to remain nimble and understand that you may not be in the phase you think you are, or that you need to operate in multiple phases at once as you deal with components of an incident—or multiple incidents at once!"

Ideally, teams should have a leader with enough seniority to make decisions for the organization in an emergency.",

Since containment often requires immediate action using security tools like firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and other security tools, the information security team can also help speed up the IR process.",
      "The team will need technical experts such as systems administrators, developers, or others from disciplines throughout the organization. The composition of the IR team may vary depending on the nature of the incident, and not all technical experts may be pulled in for every incident. Knowing the systems, software, and architecture can make a huge difference in the IR process, and familiarity can also help responders find unexpected artifacts that might be missed by someone who does not work with a specific system every day.",

      "Law enforcement is sometimes added to a team, but in most cases only when specific issues or attacks require their involvement.",
      "Regardless of the specific composition of your organization's team, you will also need to ensure that team members have proper training.

Team members are given a scenario and are asked questions about how they would respond, what issues might arise, and what they would need to do to accomplish the tasks they are assigned in the IR plan. Tabletop exercises can resemble a brainstorming session as team members think through a scenario and document improvements in their responses and the overall IR plan.",
      "Simulations can include a variety of types of events. Exercises may simulate individual functions or elements of the plan, or only target specific parts of an organization. They can also be done at full scale, involving the entire organization in the exercise. It is important to plan and execute simulations in a way that ensures that all participants know that they are engaged in an exercise so that no actions are taken outside of the exercise environment.",
      "When you conduct an exercise, start every call, text, or email with “This is an exercise” or a similar cue to let the person who is responding know that they should not take actual action. Of course, doing so can lead to biases and incorrect estimates on what effort or time would be required to perform an action or response. In most cases, keeping exercises properly under control is more important than detailed testing. In those cases where specific performance is needed, you may want to ensure that the person has a script or can perform a task that is scoped and limited to the needs of the simulation without causing problems or issues with normal operations."

      "Communication plans are critical to incident response processes. A lack of communication, incorrect communication, or just poor communication can cause significant issues for an organization and its ability to conduct business. At the same time, problematic communications can also make incidents worse, as individuals may not know what is going on or may take undesired actions, thinking they are doing the right thing due to a lack of information or with bad or partial information available to them. Because of the importance of getting communication right, communication plans may also need to list roles, such as who should communicate with the press or media, who will handle specific stakeholders, and who makes the final call on the tone or content of the communications.",
      "Stakeholder management plans are related to communication plans and focus on groups and individuals who have an interest or role in the systems, organizations, or services that are impacted by an incident. Stakeholders can be internal or external to an organization and may have different roles and expectations that need to be called out and addressed in the stakeholder management plan. Many stakeholder management plans will help with prioritization of which stakeholders will receive communications, what support they may need, and how they will be provided with options to offer input or otherwise interact with the IR process, communications and support staff, or others involved in the response process.",
      "Business continuity (BC) plans focus on keeping an organization functional when misfortune or incidents occur. In the context of IR processes, BC plans may be used to ensure that systems or services that are impacted by an incident can continue to function despite any changes required by the IR process. That might involve ways to restore or offload the services or use of alternate systems. BC plans have a significant role to play for larger incidents, whereas smaller incidents may not impact an organization's ability to conduct business in a significant way.",
      "Disaster recovery (DR) plans define the processes and procedures that an organization will take when a disaster occurs. Unlike a BC plan, a DR plan focuses on natural and human-made disasters that may destroy facilities or infrastructure, or otherwise prevent an organization from functioning normally. A DR plan focuses on restoration or continuation of services despite a disaster."

They will also require the creation and maintenance of incident handling and response procedures and practices, and they may define the overall IR process used by the organization. In some cases, they may also have specific communication or compliance requirements that are included in the overall policy based on organizational needs.",
      "It helps to bear in mind that a policy is a high-level statement of management intent that is used to convey the organization's expectations and direction for a topic. Standards will then point to a policy for their authority, while providing specific guidance about what should be done. Procedures are then used to implement standards or to guide how a task is done. Policies tend to be slow to change, whereas standards change more frequently, and procedures and guidelines may be updated frequently to handle organizational needs or technology change, or for other business-related reasons.",

If a user is connected from more than one system or device, particularly when the second device is in an unexpected or uncommon location or the application is one that isn't typically used on multiple devices at once, this can be a strong indicator that something is not right.",

      "Impossible travel, which involves a user connecting from two locations that are far enough apart that the time between the connections makes the travel impossible to have occurred, typically indicates that someone else has access to the user's credentials or devices.",
      "Resource consumption like filling up a disk or using more bandwidth than usual for uploads or downloads, can be an indicator of compromise. Unlike some of the other IoCs here, this one often requires other actions to become concerning unless it is much higher than usual.",
      "Resource inaccessibility can indicate that something unexpected is happening. If a resource like a system, file, or service isn't available identifying the underlying cause and ensuring that the cause isn't malicious, can be important.",
      "Out-of-cycle logging occurs when an event that happens at the same time or on a set cycle occurs at an unusual time. This might be a worker logging in at 2 a.m. who normally works 9–5, or a cleanup process that gets activated when it normally runs once a week.",
      "Missing logs may indicate that an attacker has wiped the logs to attempt to hide their actions. This is one reason that many organizations centralize their log collection so that a protected system will retain logs even if they are wiped on a server or workstation.",

System health and performance information may be aggregated and analyzed through those management tools in addition to being gathered at central logging servers or services.",

This can vary significantly based on what the application provides, meaning that each application and application environment will need to be analyzed and designed to support monitoring.",

      "This complex set of devices that each generate their own logs and have different log levels and events that may be important drives the importance of devices like security information and event management (SIEM) devices, which have profiles for each type of device or service and which can correlate and alert on activity based on rules and heuristic analysis."

      "In many organizations, the central security monitoring tool is a security information and event management (SIEM) tool. SIEM devices and software have broad security capabilities, which are typically based on the ability to collect and aggregate log data from a variety of sources and then to perform correlation and analysis activities with that data. This means that organizations will send data inputs—including logs and other useful information from systems, network security devices, network infrastructure, and many other sources—to a SIEM for it to ingest, compare to the other data it has, and then to apply rules, analytical techniques, and machine learning or artificial intelligence to the data. SIEM systems may include the ability to review and alert on user behavior or to perform sentiment analysis, a process by which they look at text using natural language processing and other text analysis tools to determine emotions from textual data.",
      "Another data input for SIEM devices is packet capture. The ability to capture and analyze raw packet data from network traffic, or to receive packet captures from other data sources, can be useful for incident analysis, particularly when specific information is needed about a network event. Correlating raw packet data with IDS or IPS events, firewall and WAF logs, and other security events provides a powerful tool for security practitioners.",
      "You may also encounter terms like SIM (security information management) or SEM (security event management). As the market has matured and converged, SIEM has become the most common term, but some tools may still be described as SIM or SEM due to a narrower focus or specialized capabilities.",
      "SIEM devices also provide alerting, reporting, and response capabilities, allowing organizations to see when an issue needs to be addressed and to track the response to that issue through its life cycle. This may include forensic capabilities, or it may be more focused on a ticketing and workflow process to handle issues and events."

Sensors gather useful data for the SIEM and may either forward it in its original form or do some preprocessing to optimize the data before the SIEM ingests it. Choosing where to deploy sensors is part of network and security architecture and design efforts, and sensors must be secured and protected from attack and compromise just like other network security components.",

Alerts may be set to activate only when an event has happened a certain number of times, or when it impacts specific high-value systems. Or, an alert may be set to activate once instead of hundreds or thousands of times.

Events like malware beaconing and infection are automatically categorized, prioritized, marked by source and destination, and matched to an investigation by an analyst as appropriate. They also show things like which sensor is reporting the issue.",
      "An important activity for security professionals is alert tuning, the process of modifying alerts to only alarm on important events. Alerts that are not properly tuned can cause additional work, often alerting responders over and over until they begin to be ignored. Properly tuning alerts is a key part of using alerts and alarms so that responders know that the events they will be notified about are worth responding to.",
      "Alert tuning often involves setting thresholds, removing noise by identifying false alarms and normal behaviors, and ensuring that tuning is not overly broad so that it ignores actual issues and malicious activity.",
      "One of the biggest threats to SIEM deployments is alert fatigue. Alert fatigue occurs when alerts are sent so often, for so many events, that analysts stop responding to them. In most cases, these alerts aren't critical, high urgency, or high impact and are in essence just creating noise. Or, there may be a very high proportion of false positives, causing the analyst to spend hours chasing ghosts. In either case, alert fatigue means that when an actual event occurs it may be missed or simply disregarded, resulting in a much worse security incident than if analysts had been ready and willing to handle it sooner. That's why alert tuning is so important.",

Correlation requires having data such as the time that an event occurred, what system or systems it occurred on, what user accounts were involved, and other details that can help with the analysis process. A SIEM can allow you to search and filter data based on multiple data points like these to narrow down the information related to an incident. Automated correlation and analysis is designed to match known events and indicators of compromise to build a complete dataset for an incident or event that can then be reviewed and analyzed. As you can see in Figure 14.5 from the AlienVault SIEM, you can add tags and investigations to data. Although each SIEM tool may refer to these by slightly different terms, the basic concepts and capabilities remain the same.",
      "Log aggregation isn't only done with SIEM devices or services, however. Centralized logging tools like syslog-ng, rsyslog, and similar tools provide the ability to centralize logs and perform analysis of the log data.

      "The heart of alarms, alerts, and correlation engines for a SIEM is the set of rules that drive those components. Figure 14.6 shows an example of how an alarm rule can be built using information the SIEM gathers. Rule conditions can use logic to determine if and when a rule will be activated, and then actions can trigger based on the rule. Results may be as simple as an alert or as complex as a programmatic action that changes infrastructure, enables or disables firewall rules, or triggers other defenses.",
      "Rules are important but can also cause issues. Poorly constructed rule logic may miss events or cause false positives or overly broad detections. If the rule has an active response component, a mis-triggered rule can cause an outage or other infrastructure issue. Thus, rules need to be carefully built, tested, and reviewed on a regular basis. Although SIEM vendors often provide default rules and detection capabilities, the custom-built rules that organizations design for their environments and systems are key to a successful SIEM deployment.",

It supports extremely high message rates, secure logging via TLS, and TCP-based messages as well as multiple backend database options. Another alternative is syslog-ng, which provides enhanced filtering, direct logging to databases, and support for sending logs via TCP protected by TLS. The enhanced features of syslog replacements like rsyslog and syslog-ng mean that many organizations replace their syslog infrastructure with one of these options.

      "One of the authors of this book dealt with a major issue caused by an antivirus update that incorrectly identified all Microsoft Office files as malware. That change resulted in thousands of machines taking their default action on those files. Fortunately, most of the organization used a quarantine, and then deleted settings for the antivirus product. One division, however, had set their systems to delete as the primary action. Every Office file on those systems was deleted within minutes of the update being deployed to them, causing chaos as staff tried to access their files. Although most of the files were eventually restored, some were lost as systems overwrote the deleted files with other information.",
      "This isn't a typical scenario, but understanding the settings you are using and the situations where they may apply is critical. Quarantine can be a great way to ensure that you still have access to the files, but it does run the danger of allowing the malicious files to still be on the system, even if they should be in a safe location.",
      "Configuration changes are also a common remediation and containment technique. They may be required to address a security vulnerability that allowed the incident to occur, or they may be needed to isolate a system or network. In fact, configuration changes are one of the most frequently used tools in containment and remediation efforts. They need to be carefully tracked and recorded, since responders can still make mistakes, and changes may have to be rolled back after the incident response process to allow a return to normal function. Common examples of remediation actions include:",
      "Firewall rule changes, either to add new firewall rules, modify existing firewall rules, or in some cases, to remove firewall rules.",
      "Mobile device management (MDM) changes, including applying new policies or changing policies; responding by remotely wiping devices; locating devices; or using other MDM capabilities to assist in the IR process.",
      "Data loss prevention (DLP) tool changes, which may focus on preventing data from leaving the organization or detecting new types or classifications of data from being sent or shared. DLP changes are likely to be reactive in most IR processes, but DLP can be used to help ensure that an ongoing incident has a lower chance of creating more data exposure.",
      "Content filter and URL filtering capabilities, which can be used to ensure that specific sites are not able to be browsed or accessed. Content filter and URL filtering can help prevent malware from phoning home or connecting to C2 sites, and it can also prevent users from responding to phishing attacks and similar threats.",
      "Updating or revoking certificates, which may be required if the certificates were compromised, particularly if attackers had access to the private keys for the certificates. At the same time, removing certificates from trust lists can also be a useful tool, particularly if an upstream service provider is not responding promptly and there are security concerns with their services or systems.",
      "Of course, there are many other configuration changes that you may need to make. When you're faced with an incident response scenario, you should consider what was targeted; how it was targeted; what the impact was; and what controls, configuration changes, and tools you can apply to first contain and then remediate the issue. It is important to bear in mind the operational impact and additional risks that the changes you are considering may result in, and to ensure that stakeholders are made aware of the changes or are involved in the decision, depending on the urgency of the situation.",
      "At times, broader action may also be necessary. Removing systems, devices, or even entire network segments or zones may be required to stop further spread of an incident or when the source of the incident cannot be quickly identified. The following techniques support this type of activity:",
      "Isolation moves a system into a protected space or network where it can be kept away from other systems. Isolation can be as simple as removing a system from the network or as technically complex as moving it to an isolation VLAN, or in the case of virtual machines or cloud infrastructure, it may require moving the system to an environment with security rules that will keep it isolated while allowing inspection and investigation.",
      "Containment leaves the system in place but works to prevent further malicious actions or attacks. Network-level containment is frequently accomplished using firewall rules or similar capabilities to limit the traffic that the system can send or receive. System and application-level containment can be more difficult without shutting down the system or interfering with the functionality and state of the system, which can have an impact on forensic data. Therefore, the decisions you make about containment actions can have an impact on your future investigative work. Incident responders may have different goals than forensic analysts, and organizations may have to make quick choices about whether rapid response or forensic data is more important in some situations.",
      "Segmentation is often employed before an incident occurs to place systems with different functions or data security levels in different zones or segments of a network. Segmentation can also be done in virtual and cloud environments. In essence, segmentation is the process of using security, network, or physical machine boundaries to build separation between environments, systems, networks, or other components. Incident responders may choose to use segmentation techniques as part of a response process to move groups of systems or services so that they can focus on other areas. You might choose to segment infected systems away from the rest of your network or to move crucial systems to a more protected segment to help protect them during an active incident."

      "Every organization will eventually experience a security incident, and having a solid incident response plan in place with a team who knows what they need to do is critical to appropriately handling incidents. Incident response typically follows a response cycle with preparation, detection, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned phases. Although incident response may involve all of these phases, they are not always conducted as distinct elements, and organizations and IR teams may be in multiple phases at the same time, depending on the status of the incident in question.",
      "Preparation for incident response includes building a team, putting in place policies and procedures, conducting exercises, and building the technical and information-gathering infrastructure that will support incident response needs. Incident response plans don't exist in a vacuum. Instead, they are accompanied by communications and stakeholder management plans, business continuity and disaster recovery plans, and other detailed response processes unique to each organization.",
      "Threat hunting is used to help identify information that may indicate an issue or compromise has occurred. Looking for key events like account lockouts, concurrent session usage, attempts to access blocked content, unusual resource consumption, resource inaccessibility, missing logs, and out-of-cycle logging are all examples of data that can help indicate compromise. Once they've identified an issue, responders also need a way to talk about incidents, attackers, tools, and techniques. That's where attack frameworks come into play. MITRE's ATT&CK framework is a complete knowledgebase of adversary tactics and techniques, and it has broad support in tools and systems across the information security field.",
      "A key component in many organizations' incident response plan is monitoring computing resources, including systems, applications, and infrastructure. That's often done using a security information and event management (SIEM) tool. SIEM tools centralize information gathering and analysis and provide dashboards and reporting that allow incident information to be seen and quickly identified through visualization, reporting, and manual analysis as well as automated analysis capabilities. They work with logging infrastructures using tools like syslog, syslog-ng, or others that gather and centralize logs, building logging infrastructures that capture critical information used for incident analysis. At the same time, additional information like network flows and traffic information, file and system metadata, and other artifacts are used by responders who need to analyze what occurred on a system or network.",
      "Once an incident has been identified, responders must mitigate and control it. Doing so involves changing system, device, and software configurations to prevent further issues and to stop the incident. Firewall changes, use of security tools like MDM and DLP tools, application allow lists and block lists or deny lists, and other techniques may be used to stop an incident in its tracks. These changes can be included in runbooks and playbooks that document what the organization does and what choices and processes it will follow before, during, and after it takes action. Finally, organizations conduct lessons learned activities and run root cause analysis processes to determine why an event occurred and how to prevent it in the future."

IoCs are documented and published through threat feeds and other services and sources.",
      "Data sources and data management for incident response provide insight into what occurred as well as investigative and detection tools. Security information and event management (SIEM) tools are used in many organizations to gather and analyze data using dashboards, automated analysis, and manual investigation capabilities. Information such as vulnerability scan output, system configuration data, system and device logs, and other organizational data are ingested and analyzed to provide broad insight into events and incidents. Network traffic information is gathered using NetFlow, sFlow, and packet analyzers, among other tools. They provide useful information about bandwidth usage as well as details about which systems communicated, the ports and protocols in use, time and date, and other high-level information useful for incident analysis. In addition to log and event information, metadata from files and other locations is commonly used for incident investigation and incident response.",
      "Mitigation techniques ensure that the impact of incidents are limited. Incident responders use a variety of techniques to mitigate and contain and recover from incidents. One of the most common tasks is to change configuration for endpoint security solutions as well as devices. That may include using allow lists or block/deny lists, quarantining files or devices, making firewall changes, using MDM or DLP tools, adding content or URL filtering rules, or revoking or updating certificates. At the network and infrastructure level, isolation, containment, and segmentation are all used to separate systems involved in incidents from other systems or networks. Root cause analysis is used to determine why an incident was able to happen or why it happened and to guide preparation work to avoid future incidents."

First, you will learn about legal holds, the notifications sent by opposing counsel to preserve and retain data, and chain-of-custody practices and how they play into the electronic discovery process. After reviewing those common reasons for needing forensic capabilities, you will explore forensic data acquisition, including the order of volatility, which identifies the forensic artifacts at greatest risk of being lost and thus the elements that need to be captured first. Next, you will read about how to ensure that the data you capture is admissible in court and useful as evidence, what is required as part of digital forensic preservation efforts, and what tools and agreements you must have in place to handle the need for forensic data from cloud providers.",

That data can be in the form of drives, files, copies of live memory, and any of the other multitude of digital artifacts that we create in the normal process of using computers and networks. Since forensic information can be found in many different places, planning forensic information gathering is crucial to having a complete and intact picture of what occurred.

Legal counsel can send a legal hold or litigation hold, a notice that informs an organization that they must preserve data and records that might be destroyed or modified in the course of their normal operations. Backups, paper documents, and electronic files of all sorts must be preserved.",
      "A key concept for legal holds and preservation is “spoliation of evidence,” which means intentionally, recklessly, or negligently altering, destroying, fabricating, hiding, or withholding evidence relevant to legal matters. A legal hold gives an organization notice that they must preserve that data. Ignoring the notice or mishandling data after the notice has been received can be a negative blow against an organization in court. Thus, having a strong legal hold process is important for organizations before a hold shows up.",

Discovery processes allow each side of a legal case to obtain evidence from each other and other parties involved in the case, and e-discovery is simply an electronic discovery process. In addition to legal cases, discovery processes are also often used for public records, Freedom of Information Act requests, and investigations.

      "One of the most important and simultaneously most challenging requirements in this process can be preservation of electronic information, particularly when data covered by a legal hold or discovery process is frequently used or modified by users in your organization. Electronic discovery and legal hold support tools exist that can help with abilities to capture data for users or groups under litigation hold. They often come with desktop, mobile device, and server agents that can gather data, track changes, and document appropriate data handling throughout the legal hold time frame. In organizations that are frequently operating under legal holds, it is not uncommon for frequent litigation targets like CEOs, presidents, and others to be in a near-constant state of legal hold and discovery.",
      "Cloud operations have made e-discovery even more complex. Cloud vendors provide services to many customers and will not permit you to place an intrusive legal hold and discovery agent in their cloud service. That means that as you adopt cloud services, you must address how you would deal with legal holds for those services. Tools like Google's Vault provide both email archiving and discovery support, helping organizations meet their discovery requirements."

      "When a forensic practitioner plans to acquire data, one of the first things they will review is the order of volatility. The order of volatility documents what data is most likely to be lost due to system operations or normal processes. Figure 15.1 shows a typical order of volatility chart. Note that frequently changing information like the state of the CPU's registers and cache is first and thus most volatile, and that information about routes, processes, and kernel statistics follows. As the list proceeds, each item is less likely to disappear quickly, with backups being the least likely to change. Following the order of volatility for acquisitions—unless there is a compelling and immediate reason to differ from the list—will provide a forensic analyst with the greatest likelihood of capturing data intact. It is important to remember which items will disappear when a system is powered down or rebooted. In general, that occurs at position 4 for temporary files and swap space on this list. Recovering intact temporary files and data from swap space will depend on how the system was shut down and if it was rebooted successfully afterward.",
      "FIGURE 15.1 The order of volatility",
      "When you're considering digital forensics and how to preserve live data, it helps to keep the order of volatility in mind. If you ignore it, you can lose data due to your forensic work that cannot be recovered or replaced. Common forensic locations include the following:",
      "CPU cache and registers are rarely directly captured as part of a normal forensic effort. Although it is possible to capture some of this information using specialized hardware or software, most investigations do not need this level of detail. The CPU cache and registers are constantly changing as processing occurs, making them very volatile.",
      "Ephemeral data such as the process table, kernel statistics, the system's ARP cache, and similar information can be captured through a combination of memory and disk acquisition, but it is important to remember that the capture will only be of the moment in time when the acquisition is done. If events occurred in the past, this data may not reflect the state that the system was in when the event occurred.",
      "The content of random access memory (RAM) can be very helpful for both investigations and incident response. Memory can contain encryption keys, ephemeral data from applications, and information that may not be written to the disk but that can be useful to an investigation.",
      "Swap and pagefile information is disk space used to supplement physical memory. Much like capturing information from RAM, capturing the swap and pagefile can provide insight into running processes. Since it is actively used by the system, particularly on machines with less memory, it also changes more quickly than many files on disk.",
      "Files and data on a disk change more slowly but are the primary focus of many investigations. It is important to capture the entire disk rather than just copy files so that you can see deleted files and other artifacts that remain resident.",
      "The operating system itself can contain useful information. The Windows Registry is a common target for analysis since many activities in Windows modify or update the Registry."

In fact, some organizations that face targeted attacks focus on access to their devices when those devices are plugged into untrusted or unknown USB chargers and cables. In those circumstances, USB data blockers that prevent USB data signals from being transferred while still allowing USB charging can be an effective solution.",
      "Firmware is a less frequently targeted forensic artifact, but knowing how to copy the firmware from a device can be necessary if the firmware was modified as part of an incident or if the firmware may have forensically relevant data. Firmware is often accessible using a hardware interface like a serial cable or direct USB connection or via memory forensic techniques.",

In fact, some organizations apply these rules regardless of the case to ensure that a case can be supported if it becomes necessary. Chain-of-custody forms are simple sign-off and documentation forms, as shown in Figure 15.2. Each time the drive, device, or artifact is accessed, transferred, or otherwise handled, it is documented as shown on the form.",

Evidence must be the best evidence available, and the process and procedures should stand up to challenges in court.",
      "In addition to these requirements, admissibility for digital forensics requires that the data be intact and unaltered and have provably remained unaltered before and during the forensic process. Forensic analysts must be able to demonstrate that they have appropriate skills, that they used appropriate tools and techniques, and that they have documented their actions in a reliable and testable way via an auditable trail. Thus, their efforts and findings must be repeatable by a third party if necessary."

      "Although on-site forensics have made up the bulk of traditional forensic work, the widespread move to cloud services has created new challenges for forensic analysts. Along with the need for tools and capabilities that support discovery needs, organizations are increasingly ensuring that they have worked with their cloud providers. In cloud environments, you will often have to consider:",
      "Right-to-audit clauses, which are part of the contract between the cloud service and an organization. A right-to-audit clause provides either a direct ability to audit the cloud provider or an agreement to use a third-party audit agency. Many cloud providers use standard contracts and may not agree to right-to-audit clauses for smaller organizations. In those cases, they may instead provide access to regularly updated third-party audit statements, which may fit the needs of your organization. If you have specific audit requirements, you will need to address them in the contract if possible, and decide whether or not the ability to conduct the audit is a factor in your organization's decision to adopt the cloud provider's services.",
      "Regulatory and jurisdiction concerns are also a significant element in the adoption of cloud services. Regulatory requirements may vary depending on where the cloud service provider operates and where it is headquartered. The law that covers your data, services, or infrastructure may not be the laws that you have in your locality, region, or country. In addition, jurisdictional concerns may extend beyond which laws cover the overall organization. Cloud providers often have sites around the world, and data replication and other service elements mean that your data or services may be stored or used in a similarly broad set of locations. Local jurisdictions may claim rights to access that data with a search warrant or other legal instrument. Organizations with significant concerns about this, typically address them with contractual terms, through service choices that providers make available to only host data or systems in specific areas or countries and by technical controls such as handling their own encryption keys to ensure they know if the data is accessed.",
      "Data breach notification laws, like other regulatory elements, also vary from country to country, and in the United States, notably from state to state. Contracts often cover the maximum time that can elapse before customers are notified, and ensuring that you have an appropriate breach notification clause in place that meets your needs can be important. Some vendors delay for days, weeks, or even months, potentially causing significant issues for customers who are unaware of the breach.",
      "These considerations mean that acquiring forensic data from a cloud provider is unlikely. Although you may be able to recover forensic data from logs or from systems and infrastructure you maintain in an infrastructure as a service provider's environment, forensic data from the service itself is rarely handed over to customers. Therefore, organizations that use cloud services must have a plan to handle potential incidents and investigations that doesn't rely on direct forensic techniques."

      "Although they aren't directly covered on the exam, regulatory and jurisdictional issues also come into play with two other legal concepts. The first is venue, which is the location where a case is heard. Many contracts will specify venue for cases, typically in a way that is beneficial to the service provider. If you sign a contract and don't pay attention to venue, legal cases might have to be handled far away in another state. At the same time, nexus is the concept of connection. A common example of nexus is found in the decision of whether a company has nexus in a state or locality and must charge tax there. For years, nexus was decided on whether the company had a physical location, distribution center, or otherwise did business physically in a state. Understanding how and why nexus may be decided can be important when you are considering laws and regulations that may impact your organization."

      "dd if=/dev/sda of=example.img conv=noerror,sync Additional settings are frequently useful to get better performance, such as setting the block size appropriate for the drive. If you want to use dd for forensic purposes, it is worth investing additional time to learn how to adjust its performance using block size settings for the devices and interfaces that you use for your forensic workstation.",

Hashing the original drive (/dev/sda) and comparing the hashes will let you know if you have a valid forensic image.",
      "FTK Imager is a free tool for creating forensic images. It supports raw (dd)-style format as well as SMART (ASR Data's format for their SMART forensic tool), E01 (EnCase), and AFF (Advanced Forensics Format) formats commonly used for forensic tools. Understanding what format you need to produce for your analysis tool and whether you may want to have copies in more than one format is important when designing your forensic process.",
      "Physical drives, logical drives, image files, and folders, as well as multi-CD/DVD volumes are all supported by FTK Imager. In most cases, forensic capture is likely to come from a physical or logical drive. Figure 15.3 shows a completed image creation from a physical drive using FTK Imager. Note the matching and validated MD5 and SHA1 hashes and confirmation that there were no bad blocks, which would indicate potential data loss or problems with the drive.",
      "FIGURE 15.3 Output from a completed FTK Imager image",
      "In addition to drive imaging tools, forensic analysts are sometimes asked to capture live memory on a system. Along with drive images, FTK Imager can capture live memory from a system, as shown in Figure 15.4. Here, the simple GUI lets you select where the file will go, the filename, whether the system pagefile for virtual memory should be included, and whether to save it in the AD1 native FTK file format.",
      "FIGURE 15.4 FTK Imager's Memory Capture dialog box",
      "Another useful forensic tool is WinHex, a disk editing tool that can also acquire disk images in raw format, as well as its own dedicated WinHex format. WinHex is useful for directly reading and modifying data from a drive, memory, RAID arrays, and other filesystems.",
      "If you have experience performing forensic analysis, you've likely noted that this set of tools is lacking major common tools, like EnCase, FTK, and the Volatility framework, as well as common open source forensic tools like the SANS SIFT distribution. You'll also notice a lack of network forensic access toolkits and information about containers and virtual machine capture in the exam outline. The Security+ exam focuses on broad concepts more than on specific tools, so we've focused on easily available tools for practitioners who want to gain some experience without licensing expensive commercial software."

Network forensics have an increasingly large role to play, whether they are for traditional wired and wireless networks, cellular networks, or others. Since network traffic is ephemeral, capturing traffic for forensic investigation often requires a direct effort to capture and log the data in advance. If network traffic isn't actively being logged, forensic artifacts like firewall logs, IDS and IPS logs, email server logs, authentication logs, and other secondary sources may provide information about when a device was on a network, what traffic it sent, and where it sent the traffic.",

Although this can be useful, it can also result in massive amounts of data. Capturing all or selected network traffic is a process that most organizations reserve for specific purposes rather than a general practice. Instead, most organizations end up relying on logs, metadata, traffic flow information, and other commonly collected network information to support forensic activities."

Acquisition from virtual machines requires additional planning. Unlike a server, desktop, or laptop, a VM is often running in a shared environment, where removal of the system would cause disruption to multiple other servers and services. At the same time, imaging the entire underlying virtualization host would include more data and systems than may be needed or appropriate for the forensic investigation that is in progress. Fortunately, a virtual machine snapshot will provide the information that forensic analysts need and can be captured and then imported into forensic tools using available tools.",

Since containers are designed to be ephemeral, and their resources are often shared, they create fewer forensic artifacts than a virtual or physical machine.

Container forensics require additional planning and forensic and incident response tools are becoming available to support these needs.",

If the hashes match, the forensic copy is identical to the original. Although MD5 and SHA1 are both largely outmoded for purposes where attackers might be involved, they remain useful for quickly hashing forensic images. Providing an MD5 or SHA1 hash of both drives, along with documentation of the process and procedures used, is a common part of building the provenance of the copy. The hashes and other related information will be stored as part of the chain-of-custody and forensic documentation for the case.",

When you conduct forensic analysis, it is important to preserve the full content of the drive at a bit-by-bit level, preserving the exact structure of the drive with deleted file remnants, metadata, and time stamps. Forensic copies are therefore done differently than logical copies. Hashing a file may match, but hashing a logical copy and a forensic copy will provide different values, thus making logical copies inadmissible in many situations where forensic analysis may involve legal action or unusable when changes to the drive or metadata and deleted files are critical to the investigation.",

In other words, when a file is deleted, the fastest way to make the space available is to simply delete the file's information from the drive's file index and allow the space to be reused when it is needed. Quick formatting a drive in Windows only deletes the file index instead of overwriting or wiping the drive, and other operating systems behave similarly. So, recovering files with a recovery tool or by manual means requires reviewing the drive, finding files based on headers or metadata, and then recovering those files and file fragments.",
      "In cases where a file has been partially overwritten, it is still possible to recover fragments of the files. Files are stored in blocks, with block sizes depending on the drive and operating system. If a file that is 100 megabytes long is deleted then partially overwritten by a 25 megabyte file, 75 megabytes of the original file could potentially be recovered.",

For this example, the NIST Computer Forensic Reference Data Sets (CFReDS) Rhino hunt disk competition image was used. The Rhino hunt includes a small image file and three network traces that can be viewed in Wireshark. This example focuses on the disk image file. First, as shown in Figure 15.6, you will select the type of file you are importing. Note that you can import a variety of data sources including raw disks, images, and VMs.",

This is particularly useful if you know when an incident happened or you need to find events as part of an investigation. Once you know when a person was active or the events started, you can then review the timeline for changes that were made near that time. You can also use timelines to identify active times where other events were likely to be worth reviewing. Figure 15.9 shows some of what the Autopsy timeline can help discover, with two file changes in the time frame shown. Further investigation of these times is likely to show activity related to the case.",

Always check to make sure that the time stamps for files and time settings for machines are what you expect them to be before jumping to conclusions about what happened at a specific time.",

Using a discovery model like the EDRM model can help ensure that your discovery and holds process is well planned and executed.",

      "Cloud services have included additional complexity to forensic efforts. In addition to technical concerns that can make it impossible to conduct direct forensic investigations, contractual and policy considerations need to be taken into account. Many organizations now evaluate right-to-audit clauses, regulatory and jurisdictional concerns, and data breach notification time frames as part of their contracting process for new third-party and cloud services.",

      "Legal holds and e-discovery drive some forensic activities. Organizations face legal cases and need to respond to legal holds, which require them to preserve and protect relevant information for the active or pending case. E-discovery processes also require forensic and other data to be provided as part of a legal case. Organizations must build the capability and technology to respond to these requirements in an appropriate manner to avoid losing cases in court and to support incident response processes.",

Different system components and resources are more likely to be changed or lost during the time it takes for a forensic acquisition. Thus, forensic practitioners refer to the order of volatility to determine what is the most volatile and what is the least volatile. Your forensic acquisition process should take the order of volatility into account as well as the circumstances of your acquisition process as part of incident response or legal holds to determine what to capture first.",
      "There are many options for acquisition tools, and selecting the right tool combines technical needs and skillsets. Image acquisition tools provide the ability to copy disks and volumes using a bit-by-bit method that will capture the complete image including unused or slack space. Acquisition processes vary based on where the data is located, including acquisition using snapshots of virtual machines, data volume copies for cloud environments, and disk images for workstations and mobile devices. Incident responders must bear in mind both maintaining a chain of custody and the specific technical requirements of the system or devices they are capturing data from.",
      "Validation and preservation of forensic data is a key part of the forensic process. Hashing drives and images ensures that the acquired data matches its source. Forensic practitioners continue to commonly use MD5 or SHA1 despite issues with both hashing methods because adversarial techniques are rarely at play in forensic examinations. Checksums can be used to ensure that data is not changed, but they do not create the unique fingerprints that hashes are also used to provide for forensic artifacts. Preservation requires following chain-of-custody processes as well as forethought about the use of write blockers, forensic copies, and documented processes and procedures.",
      "Forensic reports must be well organized and to the point. Forensic analysis doesn't end when the technical examination of devices and drives is over. Forensic reports summarize key findings, then explain the process, procedures and tools, and any limitations or assumptions that impact the investigation. Next, they detail the forensic findings with appropriate evidence and detail to explain how conclusions were reached. They conclude with recommendations or overall conclusions in more detail than the summary provided."

This is done through a hierarchical model, such as the one shown in Figure 16.1, which is the common governance model for publicly traded corporations.",
      "This approach is designed for use in an environment where the owners are so numerous or unengaged that they are unable to carry out day-to-day oversight of the company. This is the situation where a publicly traded company typically finds itself. The owners of that company's stock own the corporation, but they may number in the thousands or millions and their membership may change on a daily basis. It would quickly cripple a public corporation if all of its shareholders were required to vote on every action taken by the company. To alleviate this burden, the shareholders of the company conduct regular meetings where they elect a group of individuals to direct the actions of the corporation on their behalf. This group, known as the board of directors, has ultimate authority over the organization as the owners' representatives.",
      "These directors are typically drawn from the major shareholders and have expertise in corporate governance, perhaps having served as senior corporate executives themselves. Although some members of the board may also be employed as senior leaders within the organization, it is considered a best practice in corporate governance for a majority of the members of the board to be independent directors, meaning that they have no significant relationship with the company other than their board membership. In fact, the major stock exchanges each have requirements about the number of independent directors that a corporation must have to qualify for listing on the exchange.",
      "FIGURE 16.1 Typical corporate governance model",
      "Boards typically meet on a fairly infrequent basis, perhaps monthly or quarterly, so it is not practical for a board to dictate the day-to-day operations of the company. Instead, they hire a chief executive officer (CEO) who manages the company's operations. The CEO is hired by the board, may be dismissed by the board, and has their performance reviews and compensation determined by the board.",
      "Of course, the CEO also can't control every single function of the organization, so they must hire a team of executives, managers, and individual contributors to perform this work. Once again, the flow of governance cascades downward. The shareholder owners of the company delegate authority to run the organization to their elected board of directors. The board then hires and manages the CEO, who then hires and manages other senior executives, who hire and manage middle managers, who hire and manage teams of individual contributors. The size of the management hierarchy depends on the size of the organization and is intended to preserve a reasonable number of direct subordinates for each manager.",
      "The governance model described here is the one used for publicly traded companies. Nonprofit organizations follow a similar model, with the major difference being that the board members are either elected by the membership of the organization or elected in a “self-perpetuating” model, where current board members vote to elect new board members. Privately owned organizations may follow many different governance models. For example, the sole owner of a corporation may also serve as the CEO or carry out the functions of a board on their own. Alternatively, multiple owners of a corporation may each appoint a number of board members proportional to their ownership stake. There are many possible variations on this model, but the key point is that the owners control the organization either directly or through a board that they control."

These information handling standards will specify controls to manage risks to University information and related assets based on their classification. All individuals at the University are responsible for complying with these controls.",
      "By way of contrast, the federal government's Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has a 95-page information security policy. This mammoth document contains incredibly detailed requirements, such as:",
      "A record of all requests for monitoring must be maintained by the CMS CIO along with any other summary results or documentation produced during the period of monitoring. The record must also reflect the scope of the monitoring by documenting search terms and techniques. All information collected from monitoring must be controlled and protected with distribution limited to the individuals identified in the request for monitoring and other individuals specifically designated by the CMS Administrator or CMS CIO as having a specific need to know such information.",

As agencies publish their policies, the link and agency contact information should be emailed to the OCIO Policy Mailbox. The information will be added to the page within 5 working days. Agencies are responsible for notifying the OCIO if the information changes.",

      "The control must address the requirement currently and in the future.",
      "For example, an organization might find that it needs to run an outdated version of an operating system on a specific machine because the software necessary to run the business will only function on that operating system version. Most security policies would prohibit using the outdated operating system because it might be susceptible to security vulnerabilities. The organization could choose to run this system on an isolated network with either very little or no access to other systems as a compensating control.",
      "The general idea is that a compensating control finds alternative means to achieve an objective when the organization cannot meet the original control requirement. Although PCI DSS offers a very formal process for compensating controls, the use of compensating controls is a common strategy in many different organizations, even those not subject to PCI DSS. Compensating controls balance the fact that it simply isn't possible to implement every required security control in every circumstance with the desire to manage risk to the greatest feasible degree.",
      "In many cases, organizations adopt compensating controls to address a temporary exception to a security requirement. In those cases, the organization should also develop remediation plans designed to bring the organization back into compliance with the letter and intent of the original control."

The help desk is soon flooded with requests to fix the web server, and people begin troubleshooting it. They ask the web server programmers for help, and after some troubleshooting, the developers realize that the database server isn't answering queries. They then call in the database administrators to troubleshoot the database server. After a bunch of hooting, hollering, blamestorming, and finger-pointing, someone realizes that a needed port on Firewall 2 is closed. They open the port and resolve the problem—at least until this well-meaning firewall administrator closes it again or starts tinkering with Firewall 1.",

Users will now have all the access they need, improving their ability to use the network, and they will no longer bother the administrators with access requests.

An accounting employee seeking to steal funds in this manner would now need to solicit the collusion of at least one other employee, reducing the risk of fraudulent activity.",

You could have been involved in an automobile accident, encountered a train delay, or been struck by a bicycle on the sidewalk. We're aware of these risks in the back of our minds, but we don't let them paralyze us. Instead, we take simple precautions to help manage the risks that we think have the greatest potential to disrupt our lives.",
      "In an enterprise risk management (ERM) program, organizations take a formal approach to risk analysis that begins with identifying risks, continues with determining the severity of each risk, and then results in adopting one or more risk management strategies to address each risk.",
      "Before we move too deeply into the risk assessment process, let's define a few important terms that we'll use during our discussion:",
      "Threats are any possible events that might have an adverse impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of our information or information systems.",
      "Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in our systems or controls that could be exploited by a threat.",
      "Risks occur at the intersection of a vulnerability and a threat that might exploit that vulnerability. A threat without a corresponding vulnerability does not pose a risk, nor does a vulnerability without a corresponding threat.",
      "Figure 17.1 illustrates this relationship between threats, vulnerabilities, and risks.",
      "Consider the example from earlier of walking down the sidewalk on your way to work. The fact that you are on the sidewalk without any protection is a vulnerability. A bicycle speeding down that sidewalk is a threat. The result of this combination of factors is that you are at risk of being hit by the bicycle on the sidewalk. If you remove the vulnerability by parking in a garage beneath your building, you are no longer at risk for that particular threat. Similarly, if the city erects barriers that prevent bicycles from entering the sidewalk, you are also no longer at risk.",
      "FIGURE 17.1 Risk exists at the intersection of a threat and a corresponding vulnerability.",
      "Let's consider another example drawn from the cybersecurity domain. Organizations regularly conduct vulnerability scans designed to identify potential vulnerabilities in their environment. One of these scans might identify a server that exposes TCP port 22 to the world, allowing brute-force SSH attempts by an attacker. Exposing port 22 presents a vulnerability to a brute-force attack. An attacker with a brute-force scanning tool presents a threat. The combination of the port exposure and the existence of attackers presents a risk.",
      "In this case, you don't have any way to eliminate attackers, so you can't really address the threat, but you do have control over the services running on your systems. If you shut down the SSH service and close port 22, you eliminate the vulnerability and, therefore, also eliminate the risk.",
      "Of course, we can't always completely eliminate a risk because it isn't always feasible to shut down services. We might decide instead to take actions that reduce the risk. We'll talk more about those options when we get to risk management strategies later in this chapter."

There might be a high probability that we will be struck by a bicycle. That type of accident might have a moderate magnitude, leaving us willing to consider taking steps to reduce our risk. Being struck by a meteor would clearly have a catastrophic magnitude of impact, but the probability of such an incident is incredibly unlikely, leading us to acknowledge the risk and move on without changing our behavior.",
      "The laws and regulations facing an industry may play a significant role in determining the impact of a risk. For example, an organization subject to the European Union's GDPR faces significant fines if they have a data breach affecting the personal information of EU residents. The size of these fines would factor significantly into the impact assessment of the risk of a privacy breach. Organizations must, therefore, remain current on the regulations that affect their risk posture.",

      "Recurring risk assessments are performed at regular intervals, such as annually or quarterly. These assessments are meant to track the evolution of risks over time, monitor changes in the risk profile, and ensure that risk management practices are adapting to new threats and vulnerabilities.",
      "Continuous risk assessments involve ongoing monitoring and analysis of risks. This can include automated systems that constantly scan for new threats or changes in the risk environment, as well as regular reviews and updates to the risk management strategy.

Your organization uses that server to send email messages to customers offering products for sale. It generates $1,000 in sales per hour that it is in operation. After consulting threat intelligence sources, you believe that a DoS attack is likely to occur three times a year and last for three hours before you are able to control it.",
      "The asset in this case is not the server itself because the server will not be physically damaged. The asset is the ability to send emails and you have already determined that it is worth $1,000 per hour. The asset value for three hours of server operation is, therefore, $3,000.",

These are systems, devices, or other components that, if they fail, would cause an outage.

Adding a redundant power supply to the server resolves that single point of failure.

      "Risk identification and assessment helps organizations prioritize cybersecurity efforts. Cybersecurity analysts seek to identify all of the risks facing their organization and then conduct a business impact analysis to assess the potential degree of risk based on the probability that it will occur and the magnitude of the potential effect on the organization. This work allows security professionals to prioritize risks and communicate risk factors to others in the organization.",
      "Vendors are a source of external risk. Organizations should conduct their own systems assessments as part of their risk assessment practices, but they should also conduct supply chain assessments as well. Performing vendor due diligence reduces the likelihood that a previously unidentified risk at a vendor will negatively impact the organization. Hardware source authenticity techniques verify that hardware was not tampered with after leaving the vendor's premises.",
      "Organizations may choose from a variety of risk management strategies. Risk avoidance strategies change business practices to make a risk irrelevant to the organization. Risk mitigation techniques seek to reduce the probability or magnitude of a risk. Risk transference approaches move some of the risk to a third party. Risk acceptance acknowledges the risk and continues normal business operations despite the presence of the risk.",
      "Disaster recovery planning builds resiliency. Disaster recovery plans activate when an organization experiences a natural or human-made disaster that disrupts its normal operations. The disaster recovery plan helps the organization quickly recover its information and systems and resume normal operations.",
      "Privacy controls protect personal information. Organizations handling sensitive personal information should develop privacy programs that protect that information from misuse and unauthorized disclosure. The plan should cover personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI), financial information, and other records maintained by the organization that might impact personal privacy."

      "D. Managerial controls are procedural mechanisms that focus on the mechanics of the risk management process. Threat assessment is an example of one of these activities.",
      "B. The breach of credit card information may cause many different impacts on the organization, including compliance, operational, and financial risks. However, in this scenario, Jade's primary concern is violating PCI DSS, making his concern a compliance risk.",
      "C. The defacement of a website alters content without authorization and is, therefore, a violation of the integrity objective. The attackers may also have breached the confidentiality or availability of the website, but the scenario does not provide us with enough information to draw those conclusions.",
      "B. In this case, the first 12 digits of the credit card have been removed and replaced with asterisks. This is an example of data masking.",
      "D. Deterrent controls are designed to prevent an attacker from attempting to violate security policies in the first place. Preventive controls would attempt to block an attack that was about to take place. Corrective controls would remediate the issues that arose during an attack. Detective controls detect issues or indicators of issues.",
      "D. In this case, Greg must use a network-based DLP system. Host-based DLP requires the use of agents, which would not be installed on guest systems. Greg may use watermarking and/or pattern recognition to identify the sensitive information, but he must use network-based DLP to meet his goal.",
      "B. Data being sent over a network is data in transit. Data at rest is stored data that resides on hard drives, tapes, in the cloud, or on other storage media. Data in processing, or data in use, is data that is actively in use by a computer system.",
      "A. Technical controls enforce confidentiality, integrity, and availability in the digital space. Examples of technical security controls include firewall rules, access control lists, intrusion prevention systems, and encryption.",
      "D. The three primary goals of cybersecurity attackers are disclosure, alteration, and denial. These map directly to the three objectives of cybersecurity professionals: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",
      "A. The risk that Tony is contemplating could fit any one of these categories. However, his primary concern is that the company may no longer be able to do business if the risk materializes. This is a strategic risk.",
      "C. Although it is possible that a frequent flyer account number, or any other account number for that matter, could be used in identity theft, it is far more likely that identity thieves would use core identity documents. These include drivers' licenses, passports, and Social Security numbers.",
      "A. As an organization analyzes its risk environment, technical and business leaders determine the level of protection required to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their information and systems. They express these requirements by writing the control objectives that the organization wishes to achieve. These control objectives are statements of a desired security state.",
      "D. This question is a little tricky. The use of an actual guard dog could be considered a deterrent, physical, or detective control. It could even be a compensating control in some circumstances. However, the question asks about the presence of a sign and does not state that an actual dog is used. The sign only has value as a deterrent control. Be careful when facing exam questions like this to read the details of the question.",
      "D. Encryption technology uses mathematical algorithms to protect information from prying eyes, both while it is in transit over a network and while it resides on systems. Encrypted data is unintelligible to anyone who does not have access to the appropriate decryption key, making it safe to store and transmit encrypted data over otherwise insecure means.",
      "D. The use of full-disk encryption is intended to prevent a security incident from occurring if a device is lost or stolen. Therefore, this is a preventive control gap.",
      "A. Although a health-care provider may be impacted by any of these regulations, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) provides direct regulations for the security and privacy of protected health information and would have the most direct impact on a health-care provider.",
      "C. The disclosure of sensitive information to unauthorized individuals is a violation of the principle of confidentiality.",
      "B. The three primary objectives of cybersecurity professionals are confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",
      "A. Tokenization techniques use a lookup table and are designed to be reversible. Masking and hashing techniques replace the data with values that can't be reversed back to the original data if performed properly. Shredding, when conducted properly, physically destroys data so that it may not be recovered.",
      "A. PCI DSS compensating controls must be “above and beyond” other PCI DSS requirements. This specifically bans the use of a control used to meet one requirement as a compensating control for another requirement."

      "C. Hacktivists are defined by the motivation behind their actions—advancing their political or philosophical beliefs. They engage in cyberattacks that they believe will advance their causes.",
      "A. Attacks that are conducted as part of an authorized penetration test are white-hat hacking attacks, regardless of whether they are conducted by internal employees or an external firm. Kolin is, therefore, engaged in white-hat hacking. If he were acting on his own, without authorization, his status would depend on his intent. If he had malicious intent, his activity would be considered black-hat hacking. If he simply intended to report vulnerabilities to the hospital, his attack would be considered gray hat and he would likely be semi-authorized.",
      "A. Advanced persistent threats (APTs) are most commonly associated with nation-state actors. It is unlikely that an APT group would leverage the unsophisticated services of an unskilled script kiddie type attacker. It is also unlikely that a hacktivist would have access to APT resources. Although APTs may take advantage of insider access, they are most commonly associated with nation-state actors.",
      "D. The U.S. government created the Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs). ISACs help infrastructure owners and operators share threat information, and provide tools and assistance to their members.",
      "A. Nation-state actors are government sponsored, and they typically have the greatest access to resources, including tools, money, and talent.",
      "A. Email is the most common threat vector exploited by attackers who use phishing and other social engineering tactics to gain access to an organization. The other vectors listed here, direct access, wireless, and removable media, all require physical proximity to an organization and are not easily executed from a remote location.",
      "D. The Chinese military and U.S. government are examples of nation-state actors and advanced persistent threats (APTs). The Russian mafia is an example of a criminal syndicate. Anonymous is the world's most prominent hacktivist group.",
      "A. Behavioral assessments are very useful when you are attempting to identify insider threats. Since insider threats are often hard to distinguish from normal behavior, the context of the actions performed—such as after-hours logins, misuse of credentials, logins from abnormal locations, or abnormal patterns—and other behavioral indicators are often used.",
      "D. Supply chain attacks are typically associated with vendors and suppliers that provide technology infrastructure or services that may be compromised. This would include hardware and software providers as well as managed service providers (MSPs). Talent providers, who help with staffing solutions, are generally not considered common avenues for supply chain attacks.",
      "A. Tampering with equipment before it reaches the intended user is an example of a supply chain threat. It is also possible to describe this attack as a direct access attack because it involved physical access to the device, but supply chain is a more relevant answer. You should be prepared to select the best possible choice from several possible correct answers when you take the exam. Security+ questions often use this type of misdirection.",
      "B. All of these resources might contain information about the technical details of TLS, but Internet Request for Comments (RFC) documents are the definitive technical standards for Internet protocols. Consulting the RFCs would be Ken's best option.",
      "C. All of these items could be concerning, depending on the circumstances. However, API keys should never be found in public repositories because they may grant unauthorized individuals access to information and resources.",
      "A. Threat maps are graphical tools that display information about the geographic locations of attackers and their targets. These tools are most often used as interesting marketing gimmicks, but they can also help identify possible threat sources.",
      "B. Specific details of attacks that may be used to identify compromises are known as indicators of compromise (IoCs). This data may also be described as an adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP), but the fact that it is a set of file signatures makes it more closely match the definition of an IoC.",
      "A. The developers in question are using unapproved technology for business purposes. This is the classic definition of shadow IT. It is possible to describe this as data exfiltration, but there is no indication that the data security has been compromised, so shadow IT is a better description here. Remember, you will often be asked to choose the best answer from multiple correct answers on the exam.",
      "A. Tom's greatest concern should be that running unsupported software exposes his organization to the risk of new, unpatchable vulnerabilities. It is certainly true that they will no longer receive technical support, but this is a less important issue from a security perspective. There is no indication in the scenario that discontinuing the product will result in the theft of customer information or increased costs.",
      "C. Port scans are an active reconnaissance technique that probe target systems and would not be considered open source intelligence (OSINT). Search engine research, DNS lookups, and WHOIS queries are all open source resources.",
      "A, C. As a government contractor, Snowden had authorized access to classified information and exploited this access to make an unauthorized disclosure of that information. This clearly makes him fit into the category of an insider. He did so with political motivations, making him fit the category of hacktivist as well.",
      "C. Renee was not authorized to perform this security testing, so her work does not fit into the category of white-hat hacking, or authorized hacking. However, she also does not have malicious intent, so her work cannot be categorized as an unauthorized, or black-hat attack. Instead, it fits somewhere in between the two extremes and would best be described as semi-authorized, or gray-hat hacking."

      "A. Nathan should check the staff member's computer for a keylogger, which would have captured their username and password. A student could have then used the staff member's credentials to make the changes described. A rootkit would be used to retain access, spyware gathers a variety of data but is not specifically aimed at capturing keystrokes like this, and logic bombs have specific events or triggers that cause them to take action.",
      "A. Amanda has most likely discovered a botnet's command and control channel, and the system or systems she is monitoring are probably using IRC as the command and control channel. Spyware is likely to simply send data to a central server via HTTP/HTTPS, worms spread by attacking vulnerable services, and a hijacked web browser would probably operate on common HTTP or HTTPS ports (80/443).",
      "D. Remote access to a system is typically provided by a backdoor. Backdoors may also appear in firmware or even in hardware. None of the other items listed provide remote access by default, although they may have a backdoor as part of a more capable malware package.",
      "A. Bloatware is typically not a significant security threat, but it consumes resources like disk space, CPU, and memory. Unfortunately, some bloatware can be vulnerable and may not get regularly patched, meaning it's both useless and a potential risk!",
      "C. Spyware is specifically designed to gather information about users and systems and to send that data back to a central collector. Trojans pretend to be useful software and include malicious components, bloatware is preinstalled software that isn't needed, and rootkits are used to conceal malicious software and retain a foothold on compromised systems.",
      "D. One of the challenges security practitioners can face when attempting to identify malware is that different antivirus and antimalware vendors will name malware packages and families differently. This means that Matt may need to look at different names to figure out what he is dealing with.",
      "D. While keyloggers often focus on keyboard input, other types of input may also be captured, meaning Nancy should worry about any user input that occurred while the keylogger was installed. Keyloggers typically do not target files on systems, although if Nancy finds a keylogger, she may want to check for other malware packages with additional capabilities.",
      "C. Ransomware demands payment to be made while typically using encryption to make data inaccessible. Worms, viruses, and rootkits are not defined by behavior like this.",
      "B. Rootkits are designed to hide from antimalware scanners and can often defeat locally run scans. Mounting the drive in another system in read-only mode or booting from a USB drive and scanning using a trusted, known good operating system can be an effective way to determine what malware is on a potentially infected system.",
      "C. Jaya's former employee is describing a logic bomb, malicious code that will cause harm when a trigger or specific action occurs. In this case, the former employee is claiming that the trigger is them not being employed at the company. Jaya will need to assess all of the code that the employee wrote to determine if a logic bomb exists. Ransomware is a type of malicious software that typically uses encryption to extort a ransom. Extortionware is not a commonly used term. Trojans appear to be useful or desirable software but contain malicious code.",
      "B. In most malware infection scenarios, wiping the drive and reinstalling from known good media is the best option available. If the malware has tools that can infect the system BIOS/UEFI, even this may not be sufficient, but BIOS/UEFI resident malware is relatively uncommon. Multiple antivirus and antimalware tools, even if they are set to delete malware, may still fail against unknown or advanced malware packages. Destroying systems is uncommon, expensive, and unlikely to be acceptable to most organizations as a means of dealing with a malware infection.",
      "B. The key difference between worms and viruses is how they spread. Worms spread themselves, whereas viruses rely on human interaction.",
      "B. Python is an interpreted rather than a compiled language, so Ben doesn't need to use a decompiler. Instead, his best bet is to open the file and review the code to see what it does. Since it was written by an employee, it is unlikely that it will match an existing known malicious package, which means antivirus and antimalware tools and sites will be useless.",
      "B. Trojans are often found in application stores where they appear to be innocuous but desirable applications or are listed in confusingly similar ways to legitimate applications. Many organizations choose to lock down the ability to acquire applications from app stores to prevent this type of issue. Since Trojans do not self-spread and rely on user action, patching typically won't prevent them. While users may try to transfer files via USB, this isn't the most common means for modern Trojans to spread.",
      "C. Worms often spread via networks, taking advantage of vulnerabilities to install themselves on targeted systems and then to propagate further. Trojans require human interaction to install software that appears desirable. Logic bombs are embedded in code and perform actions when triggers like a date or event occur. Rootkits are used to hide malware and to conceal attacker's actions.",
      "D. Unwanted, typically preinstalled programs are known as bloatware. They take up space and resources without providing value, and many organizations either uninstall them or install clean operating system images to avoid them. There is no indication of malicious activity in the question, so these are most likely not viruses, Trojans, or spyware.",
      "A. Bots connect to command and control (C&C) systems, allowing them to be updated, controlled, and managed remotely. Worms spread via vulnerabilities, and drones and vampires aren't common terms for malware.",
      "A. Randy knows that viruses spread through user interaction with files on thumb drives. A worm would spread itself, a Trojan would look like a useful or desirable file, and there is no indication of spyware in the question."

      "D. Vishing is a form of phishing done via voice phones call or voicemail. Whaling focuses on targeting important targets for phishing attacks, whereas spoofing is a general term that means faking things. Spooning is not a technical term used for security practices.",
      "A. Michele has discovered a brute-force attack, which relies on trying a large number of passwords, often combined with a list of usernames to try. Shoulder surfing attacks involve an attacker watching as a user enters information like a password or credit card data. On-path attacks intercept data sent via a network, and pretexting is a social engineering attack that relies on a believable reason for attackers to need a victim to take action.",
      "C. Password spraying involves the use of the same password to attempt to log into multiple accounts. Joanna should search for uses of the same password for different accounts.",
      "B. Susan has most likely discovered a business email compromise and should reach out to the impacted organization to inform them of the potentially compromised account. Smishing would occur via SMS, there is nothing in the question to indicate a disinformation campaign was part of this, and there is no URL mentioned and thus typosquatting can be dismissed as well.",
      "A. Watering hole attacks rely on compromising or infecting a website that targeted users frequently visit, much like animals will visit a common watering hole. Vishing is phishing via voice, whaling is a targeted phishing attack against senior or important staff, and typosquatting registers similar URLs that are likely to be inadvertently entered in order to harvest clicks or conduct malicious activity.",
      "D. The source IP or hostname; the failed login logs with time, date, username, and other information; and the password that was used for each failed attempt would be useful for watching for brute-force attempts. Knowing where the system being logged into is located isn't useful when tracking brute-force attempts. Logging failed passwords can be problematic as it can reveal actual passwords by allowing log reviewers to see failures driven by typos, so Ben may want to avoid that sort of log even though it can be useful!",
      "B. The caller is using pretexting, providing Melissa with a story that relies on urgency and perceived authority to get her to take actions she might normally question. This social engineering attack is not a phishing attack aimed at gathering information or credentials, it does not involve business email accounts being compromised, and carding is not a topic covered in the Security+ exam outline.",
      "B. Password spraying attempts try to use a single common password for many user accounts. Determining if a single password is being used over and over can help catch basic password spraying attempts. The time, source IP, or number of failed attempts do not indicate password spraying.",
      "A. Misinformation and disinformation campaigns are primarily associated with nation-state actors, but are increasingly used by other organizations and even individuals as well. Watering hole attacks, business email compromise, and password spraying are broadly used attacks.",
      "C. Typosquatting uses misspellings and common typos of websites to redirect traffic for profit or malicious reasons. Fortunately in reality, if you visit smazon.com, you'll be redirected to the actual amazon.com website, as Amazon knows about and works to prevent this type of issue. DNS hijacking and hosts file modifications both attempt to redirect traffic to actual URLs or hostnames to different destinations, and pharming does redirect legitimate traffic to fake sites, but typosquatting is the more specific answer.",
      "B. Devon is conducting a watering hole attack that leverages a frequently visited site to deploy malware. There is no description of misinformation or disinformation in the question, and there is not a typo described that would lead to a typosquatting attack being successful.",
      "C. Brand impersonation attacks are designed to appear to be from a company that recipients are likely to be familiar with, and thus are more likely to elicit a response. While these are a type of phishing, the more specific answer of brand impersonation is the best answer. Pretexting is a social engineering concept that provides a reason for the request. Pharming attacks redirect traffic intended to be sent to a legitimate site to a fake website typically designed to simulate the real one.",
      "C. This is an example of an impersonation attack. The pentester impersonated the head of IT in order to achieve their goals. The good news is that it was a penetration tester! Smishing is phishing via SMS, vishing is phishing via voice or voicemail, and pretexting provides a reason that the target should perform an action. Here the attack relied on the authority that Amanda believed the caller had.",
      "C. Smishing attacks are SMS-based. Impersonation attacks could use texts but don't specifically rely on them. Watering hole attacks use frequently visited websites, whereas business email compromise attacks focus on gaining access to business email accounts to use in follow-up attacks.",
      "D. Sharif has discovered a spraying attack that uses the same password—often a default or common password—with many usernames. Credential harvesting is the process of gathering credentials like usernames and passwords. Impersonation is a social engineering technique used when an attacker pretends to be someone else. BEC, or business email compromise, involves attackers posing as a trusted individual and asking for actions to be performed.",
      "B. Smishing is a type of phishing that occurs via text (SMS) message.",
      "B. While it's nearly impossible to prevent typosquatting, purchasing and registering the most common typos (typo-domains) related to your organization's domain and redirecting them to your real domain is the most effective option available. Copyrighting or trademarking the domain name does not prevent typosquatting, and typo resolution is not a feature or capability that is available.",
      "B. Using an organization's brand in this way is an example of brand impersonation. While this is also an impersonation attack, the more specific description is the best answer here. Misbranding and crypto-phishing were both made up for this question and aren't commonly used terms.",
      "C. Disinformation campaigns are used to shift public opinion or to accomplish other goals. They are not limited to nation-state actors but are an increasingly heavily used social engineering tactic at a broad scale. Smishing relies on SMS messages, pretexting involves using a reason that creates urgency or importance in a request from a social engineer, and spraying is a type of password brute forcing."

      "D. Credentialed scans only require read-only access to target servers. Renee should follow the principle of least privilege and limit the access available to the scanner.",
      "C. Ryan should first run his scan against a test environment to identify likely vulnerabilities and assess whether the scan itself might disrupt business activities.",
      "C. An attack complexity of “low” indicates that exploiting the vulnerability does not require any specialized conditions.",
      "A. A false positive error occurs when the vulnerability scanner reports a vulnerability that does not actually exist.",
      "B. By allowing students to change their own grades, this vulnerability provides a pathway to unauthorized alteration of information. Brian should recommend that the school deploy integrity controls that prevent unauthorized modifications.",
      "C. Nmap is a port scanning tool used to enumerate open network ports on a system. Nessus is a vulnerability scanner designed to detect security issues on a system. Nslookup is a DNS information gathering utility. All three of these tools may be used to gather information and detect vulnerabilities. Metasploit is an exploitation framework used to execute and attack and would be better suited for the Attacking and Exploiting phase of a penetration test.",
      "A. This vulnerability is corrected by a patch that was released by Microsoft in 2017. A strong patch management program would have identified and remediated the missing patch.",
      "B. Intrusion detection systems do not detect vulnerabilities; they detect attacks. The remaining three tools could all possibly discover a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, but a web application vulnerability scanner is the most likely to detect it because it is specifically designed to test web applications.",
      "A. Moving from one compromised system to other systems on the same network is known as lateral movement. Privilege escalation attacks increase the level of access that an attacker has to an already compromised system. Footprinting and OSINT are reconnaissance techniques.",
      "A. Audits performed to validate an organization's financial statements are very formal audits that are performed by independent third-party auditors. This makes them external audits. Internal audits may be more or less formal than external audits but they are generally done only to provide assurance to internal parties and not to investors. Penetration tests may be done as part of an audit but they are not audits themselves.",
      "C. Bug bounty programs are designed to allow external security experts to test systems and uncover previously unknown vulnerabilities. Bug bounty programs offer successful testers financial rewards to incentivize their participation.",
      "D. Backdoors are a persistence tool, designed to make sure that the attacker's access persists after the original vulnerability is remediated. Kyle can use this backdoor to gain access to the system in the future, even if the original exploit that he used to gain access is no longer effective.",
      "C. WHOIS lookups use external registries and are an example of open source intelligence (OSINT), which is a passive reconnaissance technique. Port scans, vulnerability scans, and footprinting all require active engagement with the target and are, therefore, active reconnaissance.",
      "B. Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) provides a standard nomenclature for describing security-related software flaws. Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) provides a standard nomenclature for describing product names and versions. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) provides a standardized approach for measuring and describing the severity of security-related software flaws. Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE) provides a standard nomenclature for discussing system configuration issues.",
      "C. Known environment tests are performed with full knowledge of the underlying technology, configurations, and settings that make up the target. Unknown environment tests are intended to replicate what an attacker would encounter. Testers are not provided with access to or information about an environment, and instead, they must gather information, discover vulnerabilities, and make their way through an infrastructure or systems like an attacker would. Partially known environment tests are a blend of unknown environment and known environment testing. Detailed environment tests are not a type of penetration test.",
      "C. The rules of engagement provide technical details on the parameters of the test. This level of detail would not normally be found in a contract or statement of work (SOW). The lessons learned report is not produced until after the test.",
      "B. All of these techniques might provide Grace with information about the operating system running on a device. However, footprinting is a technique specifically designed to elicit this information.",
      "B. Vulnerabilities with CVSS base scores between 4.0 and 6.9 fit into the medium risk category. Vulnerability scores between 0.1 and 3.9 would be low, between 7.0 and 8.9 would be high, and those between 9.0 and 10.0 would be in the critical risk category.",
      "C. The privileges required (PR) metric indicates the type of system access that an attacker must have to execute the attack."

      "C. Charles should perform user input validation to strip out any SQL code or other unwanted input. Secure session management can help prevent session hijacking, logging may provide useful information for incident investigation, and implementing TLS can help protect network traffic, but only input validation helps with the issue described.",
      "A. A parameterized query (sometimes called a prepared statement) uses a prebuilt SQL statement to prevent SQL-based attacks. Variables from the application are fed to the query, rather than building a custom query when the application needs data. Encoding data helps to prevent cross-site scripting attacks, as does input validation. Appropriate access controls can prevent access to data that the account or application should not have access to, but they don't use precompiled SQL statements. Stored procedures are an example of a parameterized query implementation.",
      "A. Improper error handling often exposes data to users and possibly attackers that should not be exposed. In this case, knowing what SQL code is used inside the application can provide an attacker with details they can use to conduct further attacks. Code exposure is not one of the vulnerabilities we discuss in this book, and SQL code being exposed does not necessarily mean that SQL injection is possible. While this could be caused by a default configuration issue, there is nothing in the question to point to that problem.",
      "B. The application has a race condition, which occurs when multiple operations cause undesirable results due to their order of completion. De-referencing accesses or uses a memory pointer, an insecure function would have security issues in the function itself, and improper error handling would involve an error and how it was displayed or what data it provided.",
      "B. Although this example includes continuous integration, the key thing to notice is that the code is then deployed into production. This means that Susan is operating in a continuous deployment environment, where code is both continually integrated and deployed. Agile is a development methodology and often uses CI/CD, but we cannot determine if Susan is using Agile.",
      "B. Developers working on active changes to code should always work in the development environment. The test environment is where the software or systems can be tested without impacting the production environment. The staging environment is a transition environment for code that has successfully cleared testing and is waiting to be deployed into production. The production environment is the live system. Software, patches, and other changes that have been tested and approved move to production.",
      "B. All of the activities listed here may reduce the risk of the vulnerabilities created by the code. However, Ricky is specifically concerned about the fact that the organization may not be aware of all of the code that it is running. Package monitoring would inventory and monitor these third-party libraries, so that is the best answer here.",
      "B. The main benefits of automation are efficiency and time savings, enforcing baselines, standardizing infrastructure configurations, scaling in a secure manner, retaining employees, reducing reaction time, and serving as a workforce multiplier. Technical debt is one of the potential drawbacks of automation.",
      "B. This is an example of the guard rails use case for automation. Cybersecurity professionals can use scripting to automatically review user actions and block any that are outside of normal parameters.",
      "A. Automation normally increases employee retention. The common drawbacks to automation include complexity, cost, creating single points of failure, incurring technical debt, and creating challenges to ongoing supportability.",
      "D. Buffer overflow attacks occur when an attacker manipulates a program into placing more data into an area of memory than is allocated for that program's use. The goal is to overwrite other information in memory with instructions that may be executed by a different process running on the system.",
      "A. In an on-path attack, the attacker fools the user into thinking that the attacker is actually the target website and presenting a fake authentication form. They may then authenticate to the website on the user's behalf and obtain the cookie. This is slightly different from a session hijacking attack, where the attacker steals the cookie associated with an active session.",
      "A. Code signing provides developers with a way to confirm the authenticity of their code to end users. Developers use a cryptographic function to digitally sign their code with their own private key, and then browsers can use the developer's public key to verify that signature and ensure that the code is legitimate and was not modified by unauthorized individuals.",
      "A. This is an example of a reflected attack because the script code is contained within the URL. A persistent or stored attack places the content on a web page or other location where a victim may later access it. DOM-based XSS attacks hide the attack code within the Document Object Model.",
      "C. This query string is indicative of a parameter pollution attack. In this case, it appears that the attacker was waging a SQL injection attack and tried to use parameter pollution to slip the attack past content filtering technology. The two instances of the serviceID parameter in the query string indicate a parameter pollution attempt.",
      "A. The series of thousands of requests incrementing a variable indicate that the attacker was most likely attempting to exploit an insecure direct object reference vulnerability.",
      "C. In this case, the .. operators are the telltale giveaway that the attacker was attempting to conduct a directory traversal attack. This particular attack sought to break out of the web server's root directory and access the /etc/passwd file on the server.",
      "B. Websites use HTTP cookies to maintain sessions over time. If Wendy is able to obtain a copy of the user's session cookie, she can use that cookie to impersonate the user's browser and hijack the authenticated session.",

      "A. Downgrade attacks try to remove or lower the strength of encryption to allow the decryption of sensitive information. Birthday attacks find collisions where two different inputs produce the same hash value output, but there is no discussion of that in this scenario. Homomorphic encryption is not an attack but a technology that protects privacy by encrypting data in a way that preserves the ability to perform computation on that data.",

      "C. Stream ciphers operate on one character or bit of a message (or data stream) at a time. Block ciphers operate on “chunks,” or blocks, of a message and apply the encryption algorithm to an entire message block at the same time.",
      "D. AES is the successor to 3DES and DES and is the best choice for a symmetric encryption algorithm. RSA is a secure algorithm, but it is asymmetric rather than symmetric.",
      "C. The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) provides real-time checking of a digital certificate's status using a remote server. Certificate stapling attaches a current OCSP response to the certificate to allow the client to validate the certificate without contacting the OCSP server. Certificate revocation lists (CRLs) are a slower, outdated approach to managing certificate status. Certificate pinning is used to provide an expected key, not to manage certificate status.",
      "C. When the 11th employee joins Acme Widgets, they will need a shared secret key with every existing employee. There are 10 existing employees, so 10 new keys are required.",
      "B. In an asymmetric encryption algorithm, each employee needs only two keys: a public key and a private key. Adding a new user to the system requires the addition of these two keys for that user, regardless of how many other users exist.",
      "D. Extended validation (EV) certificates provide the highest available level of assurance. The CA issuing an EV certificate certifies that they have verified the identity and authenticity of the certificate subject.",

      "A. Root CAs are highly protected and not normally used for certificate issuance. A root CA is usually run as an offline CA that delegates authority to intermediate CAs that run as online CAs.",
      "C. The PFX format is most closely associated with Windows systems that store certificates in binary format, whereas the P7B format is used for Windows systems storing files in text format.",
      "A. Hardware security modules (HSMs) provide an effective way to manage encryption keys. These hardware devices store and manage encryption keys in a secure manner that prevents humans from ever needing to work directly with the keys.",
      "C. A downgrade attack is sometimes used against secure communications such as TLS in an attempt to get the user or system to inadvertently shift to less secure cryptographic modes. The idea is to trick the user into shifting to a less secure version of the protocol, one that might be easier to break.",
      "C. When encrypting a message using an asymmetric encryption algorithm, the person performing the encryption does so using the recipient's public key.",

      "A. Password complexity requirements do not prevent sharing of complex passwords, making it the least effective option from the list. Biometric authentication measures will require the enrolled user to be there, although in some cases such as fingerprint systems, multiple users could each enroll a valid fingerprint for a single account. Both types of one-time passwords could be shared but make it harder and less convenient to share accounts.",
      "B. Most cloud services provide identity and authorization tools for their services. Most, although not all, allow customers to set some or even many of the account policies they will use, and most major vendors support some form of multifactor capability.",
      "D. Password age is set to prevent users from resetting their password enough times to bypass reuse settings. Complexity, length, and expiration do not influence this.",
      "B. SMS messages are not secure and could be accessed by cloning a SIM card or redirecting VoIP traffic, among other possible threat models. Both HOTP and TOTP tokens and applications as well as biometric factors are generally considered more secure than an SMS-based factor.",
      "A. A USB security key is an example of a hard, or physical, token. An application is an example of a soft token. A biometric factor might be a fingerprint or faceprint. Attestation is a formal verification that something is true. Attestation tokens were made up for this question.",
      "B. Picture password asks users to click on specific, self-defined parts of a picture. This means that clicking on those points is something you know. Something you are involves biometric traits, and somewhere you are relies on geographic locations.",
      "A. Linux file permissions are read left to right, with the first three characters indicating read, write, and execute permissions (rwx) for the owner of the file, the second three apply to the group, and the last three to all other users. Any indicated with a – are not allowed for that set.",
      "C. Role-based access control (RBAC) sets permissions based on an individual's role, which is typically associated with their job. Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is typically matched to other attributes than the job role. Discretionary access control (DAC) and mandatory access control (MAC) are commonly implemented at the operating system level.",
      "D. Fingerprint scanners are found on many mobile devices and laptops, making them one of the most broadly deployed biometric technologies. Facial recognition is also broadly deployed, but it is not mentioned in this question or offered as an option.",
      "B. Password length has the largest impact on preventing password cracking. When paired with a strong password hash algorithm and proper use of technology like salting, long passwords are much harder to crack. Complexity is the next most important option, as preventing simple repeated characters and similar problematic passwords helps reduce the probability of easily cracked passwords being used. Reuse limitations and preventing common words are less useful.",
      "A. PINs and passwords are both examples of something you know. Something you set is not a type of factor. Biometric factors are an example of something you are, and a physical USB token would be a common example of something you have.",
      "C. Password vaulting, which stores passwords for use with proper authentication and rights, is the most appropriate solution for Marie's needs. Ephemeral accounts and just-in-time permissions are typically used under normal circumstances to provide least privilege access as needed. Token-based authentication is not specifically a PAM solution.",
      "D. Jill is able to make decisions about the rights she grants on her files, meaning this is a discretionary access control system. A mandatory access control system relies on labels to set access control rules. Rule-based access control systems rely on rules to define access, and attribute-based access control systems grant access based on attributes like job roles or locations.",
      "B. OAuth is an authentication protocol that allows services to receive authentication tokens from an identity provider without needing the user's password. LDAP is a directory service and is often used as part of SSO processes. MITRE is a nonprofit organization, and RADIUS is an authentication technology.",
      "C. Kyle can assume that his government-issued ID is being used as part of an identity proofing process to validate that he is who he claims to be. Biometric enrollment typically requires interaction with an enrollment process to scan or capture biometric information. Just-in-time permission creation is done when access is requested and does not require government ID, and federation connects identity providers with service providers, which is not described here.",
      "A. The principle of least privilege means that users should only be given the permissions necessary to perform their role. Best practice is a general term describing commonly recommended and accepted industry practices. Temporal accounts are ephemeral, or short-lived accounts. Mandatory access control is an access control scheme.",
      "C. Without other factors that would require the account to be retained, deprovisioning accounts that belonged to users who have left the organization is a best practice. Transferring accounts or reprovisioning them may expose data to new users or provide them with rights that they should not have.",
      "C. A person's name, age, location, job title, and even things like their height or their hair color are all attributes that may be associated with a person's identity. None of these describe biometric factors used for authentication, and identity factors are something you are, something you have, or somewhere you are. Account permissions determine what you can do, not attributes like these.",
      "C. Linux users can change who can read, write, or execute files and directories they own, which is discretionary access control (DAC). Mandatory access control (MAC) would enforce settings set by the systems administrator without users having the rights to make their own decisions. While role-based access control is involved, DAC best describes the access control scheme. ABAC is not a default method for setting rights for the Linux filesystem."

      "A. Naomi should select a load balancing solution. Load balancers allow multiple systems or services to appear like a single resource and can take systems out of the load-balanced pool to allow for upgrades or changes in resources required. Clustering is used to allow groups of computers to perform the same task, but without a load balancer cannot provide the same transparent service appearing as the same system. Geographic diversity and hot sites are concepts used to provide resilience but don't provide this capability.",
      "D. Differential backups back up the changes since the last full backup. Incremental backups back up changes since the last backup, and snapshots are a live copy of a system. This is not a full backup, because it is capturing changes since a full backup.",
      "B. Warm sites have systems, connectivity, and power but do not have the live or current data to immediately take over operations. A hot site can immediately take over operations, whereas a cold site has space and power, and likely connectivity, but will require that systems and data be put in place to be used. Cloud sites are not one of the three common types of recovery sites.",
      "C. Testing that involves an actual failover to another site or service is failover testing. Parallel processing runs both sites or services at the same time; simulation and tabletops both review what would happen without making the actual change.",
      "B. Virtual machine snapshots capture the machine state at a point in time and will allow Felix to clone the system. A full backup and a differential backup can be used to capture the disk for the machine but typically will not capture the memory state and other details of the system state. Live boot media allows you to boot and run a nonpersistent system from trusted media.",
      "A. A documented restoration order helps ensure that systems and services that have dependencies start in the right order and that high-priority or mission-critical services are restored first. TOTP and HOTP are types of one-time password technology, and last-known good configurations are often preserved with a snapshot or other technology that can allow a system to return to a known good status after an issue such as a bad patch or configuration change.",
      "D. Bollards are physical security controls that prevent vehicles from accessing or ramming doors or other areas. They may look like pillars, planters, or other innocuous objects. An air gap is a physical separation of technology environments; a hot aisle is the aisle where systems in a datacenter exhaust warm air; and unlike in movies, robotic sentries are not commonly deployed and aren't ready to stop vehicles in most current circumstances.",
      "D. Encryption is commonly used to ensure that backup media or data that is exposed is not accessible to third parties. This does mean that Alecia must carefully secure the encryption keys for the backup. Hashing that data would not keep it secure, and if only hashes were stored the data would be unrecoverable. Security guards are expensive and not a complete solution if data is inadvertently exposed, and offsite, secure storage locations are a useful and common solution for organizations that want to have remote backups.",
      "C. Offsite journaling will allow transactions to be recorded and to remain available if a significant event occurred that involved his datacenter. Snapshots are useful at a point in time but do not retain a transaction log between snapshots.",
      "A. Resilience requires capacity planning to ensure that capacity—including staff, technology, and infrastructure—is available when is needed. Although a generator, UPS, various RAID levels, and backups have their place in disaster recovery and contingency planning, they are not the primary focus of resiliency and capacity planning.",
      "A. Synchronous replication occurs in real time, whereas asynchronous replication occurs after the fact but more regularly than a backup. Journaled and snapshot-based replication are not specific types of replication.",
      "C. Security guards can be one of the costliest physical security controls over time, making the cost of guards one of the most important deciding factors guiding when and where they will be employed. Reliability, training, and the potential for social engineering are all possible issues with security guards, but none of these is the major driver in the decision process.",
      "A. Infrared sensors balance lower cost with the ability to detect humans entering and moving in a space. Microwave sensors are more expensive but can provide better coverage, including traveling through some barriers. Ultrasonic sensors are rarely used for this purpose, and pressure sensors are limited to the pad where they are deployed, making them expensive and challenging to use for rooms or larger spaces.",
      "C. Fences, lighting, and video surveillance can all help discourage potential malicious actors from entering an area, although a determined adversary will ignore or bypass all three. Platform diversity can help make it harder for attackers to succeed, but this is primarily a resilience tactic, and remains more costly to maintain and implement.",
      "D. Technology diversity helps ensure that a single failure—due to a vendor, vulnerability, or misconfiguration—will not impact an entire organization. Technology diversity does have additional costs, including training, patch management, and configuration management.",
      "D. Scott has implemented an offsite backup scheme. His backups will take longer to retrieve because they are at a remote facility and will have to be sent back to him, but they are likely to survive any disaster that occurs in his facility or datacenter. Onsite backups are kept immediately accessible, whereas nearline backups can be retrieved somewhat more slowly than online backups but faster than offline backups. “Safe backups” is not an industry term.",
      "A. Security guards who can monitor for and understand the signs of a physical brute-force attempt are the most useful control listed. Locks may show signs of attempts but require careful inspection, access badges would require log review and additional information to detect brute-force attacks, and an IDS is useful for network attacks.",
      "B. A tabletop exercise is the least disruptive form of exercise. Even simulations have some risk if an employee does not fully realize that the scenario is simulated and takes action. Failover, even partial, involves the potential for disruption.",
      "B. An access control vestibule uses a pair of doors. When an individual enters, the first door must be closed and secured before the second door can be opened. This helps prevent tailgating, since the person entering will notice anybody following them through the secured area. A Faraday cage is used to stop electromagnetic interference (EMI), a bollard prevents vehicular traffic, and an air gap is a physical separation of networks or devices.",
      "C. Geographic dispersion helps ensure that a single natural or human-made disaster does not disable multiple facilities. This distance is not required by law; latency increases with distance; and though there may be tax reasons in some cases, this is not a typical concern for a security professional."

Fog computing is a related concept that uses IoT gateway devices that are located in close physical proximity to the sensors.",

Cloud transit gateways extend this model even further, allowing the direct interconnection of cloud VPCs with on-premises VLANs for hybrid cloud operations. Secure web gateways (SWGs) provide a layer of application security for cloud-dependent organizations. Hardware security modules (HSMs) are special-purpose computing devices that manage encryption keys and also perform cryptographic operations in a highly efficient manner.",
      "D. Virtual machine (VM) escape vulnerabilities are the most serious issue that can exist in a virtualized environment, particularly when a virtual host runs systems of differing security levels. In an escape attack, the attacker has access to a single virtual host and then manages to leverage that access to intrude upon the resources assigned to a different virtual machine. The hypervisor is supposed to prevent this type of access by restricting a virtual machine's access to only those resources assigned to that machine.",
      "A. Controls offered by cloud service providers have the advantage of direct integration with the provider's offerings, often making them cost-effective and user-friendly. Third-party solutions are often more costly, but they bring the advantage of integrating with a variety of cloud providers, facilitating the management of multicloud environments.",
      "C. Cloud access security brokers (CASBs) are designed specifically for this situation: enforcing security controls across cloud providers. A secure web gateway (SWG) may be able to achieve Kira's goal, but it would be more difficult to do so. Security groups and resource policies are controls used in IaaS environments.",
      "D. The principle of data sovereignty states that data is subject to the legal restrictions of any jurisdiction where it is collected, stored, or processed. In this case, Howard needs to assess the laws of all three jurisdictions.",

      "A. This is an example of public cloud computing because Tony is using a public cloud provider, Microsoft Azure. The fact that Tony is limiting access to virtual machines to his own organization is not relevant because the determining factor for the cloud model is whether the underlying infrastructure is shared, not whether virtualized resources are shared."

      "B. Legacy hardware is unsupported and no longer sold. End-of-life typically means that the device is no longer being made but is likely to still have support for a period of time. End-of-sales means the device is no longer being sold, but again, may have support for some time. Senescence is not a term typically used in hardware life cycles.",
      "C. The services listed are: 21—FTP",
      "Of these services, SSH (Port 22) and HTTPS (port 443) are secure options for remote shell access and HTTP. Although secure mode FTP (FTP/S) may run on TCP 21, there is not enough information to know for sure, and HTTPS can be used for secure file transfer if necessary. Thus, Naomi's best option is to disable all three likely unsecure protocols: FTP (port 21), Telnet (port 23), and HTTP (port 80).",
      "C. Protecting data using a DLP requires data classification so that the DLP knows which data should be protected and what policies to apply to it. Defining data life cycles can help prevent data from being kept longer than it should be and improves data security by limiting the data that needs to be secured, but it isn't necessary as part of a DLP deployment. Encrypting all sensitive data may mean the DLP cannot recognize it and may not be appropriate for how it is used. Tagging all data with a creator or owner can be useful but is not required for a DLP rollout—instead, knowing the classification of the data is more important.",
      "C. Oliver should look for a key management system, or KMS, which will allow him to securely create, store, and manage keys in a cloud environment. TPMs, secure enclaves, and Google's Titan M are all local hardware solutions.",
      "C. XDR is similar to EDR but has a broader perspective covering not only endpoints but also cloud services, security platforms, and other components. Thus, the breadth of coverage of the technology stack is broader for XDR solutions.",
      "B. A Windows Group Policy Object (GPO) can be used to control whether users are able to install software. Antivirus will not stop this, nor will EDR or a HIPS.",
      "A. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems provide monitoring, detection, and response capabilities for systems. EDR systems capture data from endpoints and send it to a central repository, where it can be analyzed for issues and indicators of compromise or used for incident response activities. IAM is identity and access management, FDE is full-disk encryption, and ESC is not a commonly used security acronym.",
      "D. Network devices as well as many other devices like printers come with default passwords set. Fred should change the default password as part of the process of setting up his new router.",
      "B. A host-based intrusion prevention system (HIPS) can detect and prevent attacks against services while allowing the service to be accessible. A firewall can only block based on port, protocol, and IP; encryption won't prevent this; and an EDR is primarily targeted at malicious software and activity, not at network-based attacks on services.",
      "A. Unlike computers and mobile devices, switches and other network devices typically do not have additional software that can be removed. Installing patches, placing administrative interfaces on protected VLANs, and changing default passwords are all common hardening techniques for network devices like switches.",
      "B. Since the web interfaces are needed to manage the devices, Helen's best option is to place the IoT devices in a protected VLAN. IoT devices will not typically allow additional software to be installed, meaning that adding firewalls or a HIPS won't work.",
      "A. Removing unnecessary software helps to reduce the attack surface of the devices. Not all software runs a service or opens a network port, but installed software provides additional opportunities for attackers to find vulnerabilities. That means that reducing firewall rules is not a primary purpose. While removing it may reduce the number of patches required by a device, that is not the primary driver. Finally, while incident response efforts may point to a need for further hardening to prevent future incidents, removing unnecessary software is not a typical step in support of IR activities.",
      "A. SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) is a system architecture that combines data acquisition and control devices with communications methods and interfaces to oversee complex industrial and manufacturing processes, just like those used in utilities. A SIM (subscriber identity module) is the small card used to identify cell phones; HVAC stands for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning; and AVAD was made up for this question.",
      "D. A real-time operating system (RTOS) is an OS that is designed to handle data as it is fed to the operating system, rather than delaying handling it as other processes and programs are run. Real-time operating systems are used when processes or procedures are sensitive to delays that might occur if responses do not happen immediately. An MFP is a multifunction printer, a HIPS is a host intrusion prevention system, and an SoC is a system on a chip—which is hardware, which might run an RTOS, but the option does not mention what type of OS the SoC is running.",
      "B. Embedded systems are available at many price points. Understanding constraints that limited resources create for embedded systems helps security professionals identify appropriate security controls and options.",
      "A. Jim knows that once a BitLocker-enabled machine is booted, the drive is unlocked and could be accessed. He would be least worried if the machine were off and was stolen, or if the drive itself were stolen from the machine, since the data would not be accessible in either of those cases.",
      "B. Olivia should install a host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS). An HIDS can detect and report on potential attacks but does not have the ability to stop them. A host-based intrusion prevention system (HIPS) can be configured to report only on attacks, but it does have the built-in ability to be set up to block them. Firewalls can block known ports, protocols, or applications, but they do not detect attacks—although advanced modern firewalls blur the line between firewalls and other defensive tools. Finally, a data loss prevention (DLP) tool focuses on preventing data exposures, not on stopping network attacks.",
      "B. Group Policy deployed via Active Directory will allow Anita to set security settings across her domain managed systems. EDR and XDR are useful for detecting and responding to malware and malicious actors but not for deploying security configurations. SELinux is a Linux kernel-based security module that provides additional security capabilities and options on top of existing Linux distributions.",
      "C. Chris knows that BIOS-based systems do not support either of these modes, and that trusted boot validates every component before loading it, whereas measured boot logs the boot process and sends it to a server that can validate it before permitting the system to connect to the network or perform other actions.",
      "A. A degausser is a quick and effective way to erase a tape before it is reused. Wiping a tape by writing 1s, 0s, or a pattern of 1s and 0s to it will typically be a slow operation and is not a common method of destroying data on a tape. Incinerating the tape won't allow it to be reused!"

      "D. DNS reputation services can provide Jill with an automated feed of malicious sites that she can include in her DNS filter. OSINT (open source intelligence) is gathered without scans but typically won't provide DNS block lists. STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) prevents loops in networks and is not relevant to DNS filtering, and an access control monitoring service will not be either.",
      "B. Jump servers are used to provide secure, monitored access to a protected network. Users log in to the jump server, which then has access to the network. Proxies are used to filter or manage traffic and might be used in this scenario, but jump servers are the preferred answer for most organizations and uses. A VLAN (virtual LAN) is used to logically separate network segments. An air gap is a physical disconnection between networks or devices.",
      "A. A next-generation firewall (NGFW) device is typically designed and built to be more capable at high speeds and throughput than a universal threat management device. Since UTM devices provide such a wide array of services that consume CPU and memory resources, this performance gap can also sometimes be due to the broad set of services that a UTM device provides. A WAF (web application firewall) is specialized in web traffic, and SD-FW was made up for this question.",
      "A. DNSSEC validates both the origin of DNS information and ensures that DNS responses have not been modified, making it the best option to help prevent DNS poisoning attacks. SDNS was made up for this question. SASE is used to secure networks in complex multilocation environments, and SD-WAN allows for dynamic wide area networks defined by software, but neither provides this type of DNS security.",
      "C. SD-WAN (software-defined wide area network) is commonly used to replace MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching) networks, which are typically higher cost than other connectivity options. IPSec and TLS-based VPNs are used to connect through untrusted networks, but they do not provide the functionality required. SASE uses SD-WAN and other technologies to ensure secure connectivity in complex network infrastructures with endpoints in many locations.",
      "D. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is commonly used to wrap (protect) otherwise insecure protocols. In fact, many of the secure protocols simply add TLS to protect them. ISAKMP and IKE are both used for IPSec and can be used to wrap insecure protocols, but they aren't used alone. SSL is no longer used; TLS has almost entirely replaced it, although SSL is still often casually referred to as TLS.",
      "D. While many protocols have a secure version, DHCP does not have a secure option, and protection must be handled by using detection and response mechanisms, rather than an encrypted protocol.",
      "B. Policy enforcement points communicate with policy administrators to forward requests from subjects and to receive instructions from them about connections to allow or end. Policy administrators are components that establish or remove the communication path between subjects and resources, including creating session-specific authentication tokens or credentials as needed. Policy engines make policy decisions based on both rules and external systems. Policy gateways are not reference components for zero-trust designs.",
      "C. End users may use secure POP (POPS), secure IMAP (IMAPS), and secure HTTP (HTTPS) to retrieve email. SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are used to identify and validate email servers, not to access email by end users.",
      "A. Physical isolation like an air gap is used when the additional work to manually transfer files is an acceptable trade-off against the potential for a security event caused by potential network-based attackers. Firewall rules, an IPS, or the use of IPSec to protect traffic will not sufficiently address this issue if any services remain accessible on the system.",
      "B. Active/active designs spread traffic among active nodes, helping ensure that a single node will not be overwhelmed. Active/passive designs are useful for disaster recovery and business continuity, but they do not directly address heavy load on a single node. There are many load-balancing schemes, but daisy chains and duck-duck-goose are not among them.",
      "A. Agent-based, preadmission NAC will provide Isaac with the greatest amount of information about a machine and the most control about what connects to the network and what can impact other systems. Since systems will not be connected to the network, even to a quarantine or preadmission zone, until they have been verified, Isaac will have greater control.",
      "D. SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) combines network security and device security by leveraging SD-WAN with security tools like Zero Trust, firewalls, and cloud access security brokers (CASBs). Both UTM and NGFW are advanced firewalls but do not provide this full functionality, and IPSec is a protocol used to provide encryption and authentication for network traffic.",
      "B. Browser on-path attacks take advantage of malicious browser plug-ins or proxies to modify traffic at the browser level. They do not involve compromised routers or servers, and a modified hosts file is more likely to be involved in an on-path attack.",
      "C. Understanding what services your organization offers to the outside world is an important step in describing the organization's attack surface. Fail open and fail closed describe what happens when devices or systems fail, not vulnerability and service availability information. OSINT is a passive process and scanning is not a passive activity.",
      "A. DNSSEC does not encrypt data but does rely on digital signatures to ensure that DNS information has not been modified and that it is coming from a server that the domain owner trusts. DNSSEC does not protect confidentiality, which is a key thing to remember when discussing it as a security option. TLS, an IPSec VPN, or encryption via AES are all potential solutions to protect the confidentiality of network data.",
      "C. Out-of-band management places the administrative interface of a switch, router, or other device on a separate network or requires direct connectivity to the device to access and manage it. This ensures that an attacker who has access to the network cannot make changes to the network devices. NAC and port security help protect the network itself, whereas trunking is used to combine multiple interfaces, VLANs, or ports together."

      "D. Using a containerization system can allow Fred's users to run corporate applications and to use corporate data in a secure environment that cannot be accessed by other applications outside of the container on the device. Containerization schemes for mobile devices typically use encryption and other isolation techniques to ensure that data and applications do not cross over. Biometrics and context-aware authentication are useful for ensuring that the right user is using a device but don't provide this separation. Full-device encryption helps reduce the risk of theft or loss of a device resulting in a data breach.",
      "B. Geofencing will allow Michelle to determine what locations the device should work in. The device will then use geolocation to determine when it has moved and where it is. In this case, the correct answer is therefore geofencing—simply having geolocation capabilities would not provide the solution she needs. Context-aware authentication can help by preventing users from logging in when they aren't in the correct location, but a device that was logged in may not require reauthentication. Finally, UEM, much like mobile device management, can be used to enforce these policies, but the most correct answer is geofencing.",
      "D. When access points conflict, enterprise wireless network management tools will typically decrease the power for both access points until the issue is resolved. Simply increasing power will cause more conflicts, changing the SSID would not serve typical enterprise models that use a single SSID to allow roaming, and disabling an access point may leave coverage gaps.",
      "C. Nearfield communication (NFC) is not typically used for geolocation because of its extremely short range. Geolocation services may use GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth to identify areas, access points, Bluetooth beacons, and other items that help with location services.",
      "A. Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) is used to establish a secure peering environment and to protect session traffic. Since the process requires additional cryptographic steps, it causes brute-force attacks to be much slower and thus less likely to succeed while also providing more security than WPA2's preshared key (PSK) mode. WPS is Wi-Fi Protected Setup, a quick setup capability; CCMP is the encryption mode used for WPA2 networks. WPA3 moves to 128-bit encryption for Personal mode and can support 192-bit encryption in Enterprise mode.",
      "C. Isabelle should select PEAP, which doesn't require client certificates but does provide TLS support. EAP-TTLS provides similar functionality but requires additional software to be installed on some devices. EAP-FAST focuses on quick reauthentication, and EAP-TLS requires certificates to be deployed to the endpoint devices.",
      "A. Storage segmentation is the concept of splitting storage between functions or usage to ensure that information that fits a specific context is not shared or used by applications or services outside of that context. Full-device encryption encrypts the entire device, geofencing is used to determine geographic areas where actions or events may be taken by software, and multifactor storage was made up for this question.",
      "C. Sideloading is the process of copying files between two devices like a phone and a laptop, desktop, or storage device. Jake's team member has loaded an application without using the Android application store. Sideloading does not necessarily imply malware, rooting, or disabling an MDM, although an MDM may be configured to prevent sideloading.",
      "B. SMS (Short Message Service) is used to send text messages, and MMS and RCS provide additional multimedia features. Neither provides phone calls or firmware updates.",
      "C. Geotagging places a location stamp in documents and pictures that can include position, time, and date. This can be a serious privacy issue when pictures or other information are posted, and many individuals and organizations disable GPS tagging. Organizations may want to enforce GPS tagging for some work products, meaning that the ability to enable or disable it in an MDM tool is quite useful. Chain of custody is a forensic concept, the ability to support geofencing does not require GPS tagging, and context-aware authentication may need geolocation but not GPS tagging.",
      "A. This is an ad-hoc network set up to allow devices to connect to the access point provided by the cellular modem. NFC is a short range, low bandwidth connection method used for payments and similar purposes. Point-to-point connections are used to bridge two networks together or for single connections, this is a multi-device network. RFID uses tags and readers.",
      "B. Susan's best options are to use a combination of full-device encryption (FDE) and remote wipe. If a device is stolen and continues to be connected to the cellular network, or reconnects at any point, the remote wipe will occur. If it does not, or if attackers attempt to get data from the device and it is locked, the encryption will significantly decrease the likelihood of the data being accessed. Of course, cracking a passcode, PIN, or password remains a potential threat. NFC and Wi-Fi are wireless connection methods and have no influence on data breaches due to loss of a device. Geofencing may be useful for some specific organizations that want to take action if devices leave designated areas, but it is not a general solution. Containerization may shield data, but use of containers does not immediately imply encryption or other protection of the data but simply that the environments are separated.",
      "C. Current mobile device implementations have focused heavily on facial recognition via services like Apple's Face ID and fingerprint recognition like Android's fingerprint scanning and Apple's Touch ID. Gait recognition is not a widely deployed biometric technology and would be difficult for most mobile device users to use. Voice recognition as a biometric authenticator has not been broadly deployed for mobile devices, whereas voice-activated services are in wide usage.",
      "B. Jailbreaking will allow Alaina to obtain administrator access to the underlying phone operating system and to modify operating system settings and options as well as to install applications that are not available via the App Store. Deploying an MDM does not permit all of this, keymodding is not a term used in this context, and installing a third-party OS would allow access but would change the OS.",
      "D. Jerome should deploy a captive portal that requires users to provide information before being moved to a network segment that allows Internet access. WPS capture mode was made up for this question, Kerberos is used for enterprise authentication, and WPA2 supports open, enterprise, or PSK modes but does not provide the capability Jerome needs by itself.",
      "C. Amanda wants to create a heatmap, which shows the signal strength and coverage for each access point in a facility. Heatmaps can also be used to physically locate an access point by finding the approximate center of the signal. This can be useful to locate rogue access points and other unexpected or undesired wireless devices. PSK stands for preshared key, a channel overlay is not a commonly used term (although channel overlap is a concern for channels that share bandwidth), and SSID chart was made up for this question.",

Choose your own device (CYOD) allows users to choose a device but then centrally manages it. BYOD allows users to use their own device, rather than have the company provide it, and MOTD means message of the day, and is not a mobile device deployment scheme.",
      "C. Bluesnarfing is the theft of information from a Bluetooth enabled device. If Octavia left Bluetooth on and had not properly secured her device, then an attacker may have been able to access her contact list and download its contents. A bluejacking attack occurs when unwanted messages are sent to a device via Bluetooth. Evil twins are malicious access points configured to appear to be legitimate access points, and an evil maid attack is an in-person attack where an attacker takes advantage of physical access to hardware to acquire information or to insert malicious software on a device."

Sampling, as well as the implementation methods for sFlow, means that it scales well to handle complex and busy networks. Although vulnerabilities may exist in sFlow collectors, a buffer overflow is not a primary concern for them.",

Tabletop exercises are conducted with more flexibility—team members are given a scenario and asked how they would respond and what they would do to accomplish tasks they believe would be relevant.

      "C. Missing logs are often associated with an attacker attempting to hide evidence of their actions. Log rotation will typically remove the oldest log items and replace them with new log items rather than wiping a log, or will archive the old log file and create a new one. A newly deployed system typically has at least some logs from booting and running. Encrypting logs would leave a file in place even if it couldn't be read.",
      "B. Ian's first step should be changing the sensitivity for his alerts. Adjusting the alerts to ignore safe or expected events can help reduce false positives. Correlation rules may then need to be adjusted if they are matching unrelated items. Dashboards are used to visualize data, not for alerting, and trend analysis is used to feed dashboards and reports.",
      "C. Members of management or organizational leadership act as a primary conduit to senior leadership for most incident response teams. They also ensure that difficult or urgent decisions can be made without needing escalated authority. Communications and PR staff focus on internal and external communications but are typically not the direct conduit to leadership. Technical and information security experts do most of the incident response work itself.",
      "D. This is an example of out-of-cycle logging, or logging that occurs at a different time than expected. This may be because an attacker is using the backup tool to acquire data. Unexpected logs are not an indicator found on the Security+ exam outline. There is no indication of resource consumption or inaccessibility in the question.",
      "C. Red Hat Enterprise uses journalctl to view journal logs that contain application information. Jim should use journalctl to review the logs for the information he needs. The tool also provides functionality that replicates what head and tail can do for logs. Syslog-ng is a logging infrastructure, and though logs may be sent via syslog-ng, it is not mentioned here. logger is a logging utility used to make entries in the system log.",

      "A. Containment activities focus on preventing further malicious actions or attacks. In this case, Hitesh might opt to prevent the malware from spreading but leave the system online due to a critical need or a desire to preserve memory and other artifacts for investigation. Isolation walls a system or systems off from the rest of the world, whereas segmentation is frequently used before incidents occur to create zones or segments of a network or system with different security levels and purposes.",
      "D. The Analysis phase focuses on using various techniques to analyze events to identify potential incidents. Preparation focuses on building tools, processes, and procedures to respond to incidents. Eradication involves the removal of artifacts related to the incident, and containment limits the scope and impact of the incident.",
      "C. Vulnerability scans are the best way to find new services that are offered by systems. In fact, many vulnerability scanners will flag new services when they appear, allowing administrators to quickly notice unexpected new services. Registry information is not regularly dumped or collected in most organizations. Firewall logs and flow logs could show information about the services being used by systems whose traffic passes through them, but this is a less useful and accurate way of identifying new services and would work only if those services were also being used."

Finally, patch levels or installed versions are not critical unless there are known issues that would have been described as such.",
      "A. If forensic evidence was not properly handled, it may not be admissible in court. Repeating forensic activities won't reverse mishandling, staff can't go back and re-create logs, and noting the issue will not resolve it.",
      "B. Mike's best option is to identify the log information available from the provider and to request any additional information knowing that he may not receive more detail unless there is contractual language that specifies it. SaaS vendors typically won't allow installation of forensic tools, law enforcement does not perform forensic acquisition for third parties upon request, and auditors don't provide forensic data acquisition either.",
      "C. Creating a snapshot will provide a complete copy of the system, including memory state that can then be analyzed for forensic purposes. Copying a running system from a program running within that system can be problematic, since the system itself will change while it is trying to copy itself. FTK Imager can copy drives and files, but it would not handle a running virtual machine.",
      "B. Even though Wireshark is not a dedicated network forensic tool, since network traffic is ephemeral, capturing it with a packet sniffer like Wireshark is Melissa's best option. Forensic suites are useful for analyzing captured images, not capturing network traffic, and dd and WinHex are both useful for packet capture, but not for network traffic analysis.",
      "D. Forensic information does not have to include a time stamp to be admissible, but time stamps can help build a case that shows when events occurred. Files without a time stamp may still show other information that is useful to the case or may have other artifacts associated with them that can provide context about the time and date.",
      "D. Chain-of-custody documentation tracks evidence throughout its life cycle, with information about who has custody or control and when transfers happened, and continues until the evidence is removed from the legal process and disposed of. The other terms are not used for this practice.",
      "B. The most common cause of an hour of difference between two systems in an environment is an incorrectly set time zone. Isaac should check the time zone settings, and then correct his findings based on the time zones set on the systems if necessary.",
      "C. Jurisdiction is the legal authority over an area or individuals based on laws that create the jurisdiction. Nexus defines whether a relationship or connection exists, such as a local branch or business location. Non-repudiation ensures that evidence or materials can be connected to their originator. Admissibility determines whether evidence can be used in court.",
      "A. Firmware can be challenging to access, but both memory forensic techniques and direct hardware interface access are viable means in some cases. Firmware is not typically stored on the disk and instead is stored in a BIOS or UEFI chip. Removing the chip from the system will leave it unable to run and thus this is not a preferred method. Also, many chips are not removable. Shutting down the device and booting it to the firmware does not provide a means of copying the firmware for most devices. Although the firmware is likely to allow updates, most do not allow downloads or copying.",
      "C. Although it may be tempting to use a technical answer, interviewing the individual involved is the best starting point when a person performed actions that need to be reviewed. Charles can interview the staff member, and then move on to technical means to validate their responses. System and event logs may have some clues to what occurred, but normal systems do not maintain a keystroke log. In fact, the closest normal element is the command log used by both Windows and Linux to allow command-line input to be recalled as needed.",
      "B. Once a copy is made, hashes for the original and target drive should be compared to ensure that the copy was successful. After that, the chain-of-custody document can be updated to note that a copy was made and will be tracked as it is analyzed while the original is preserved. Wiping either drive after a copy is not part of the process, although a target drive may be wiped after a case is complete.",
      "B. Quick-formatting a drive removes the file indexes but leaves the file content on the drive. Recovery tools look for those files on the drive and piece them back together using metadata, headers, and other clues that help to recover the files.",
      "B. Contracts commonly include right to audit, choice of jurisdiction, and data breach notification time frame clauses, but a right to forensically examine a vendor's systems or devices is rarely included. Naomi may want to ask about their incident response process and for examples of previous breach notification and incident documentation shared with customers instead.",
      "D. Chain of custody tracks who has an item, how it is collected, where it is stored and how, how it is secured or protected, who collected it, and transfers, but it does not typically include how the items were transported because that is not relevant if the other data is provided.",
      "C. It is important to ensure that data prepared for e-discovery only contains what it is supposed to, and that information that should not be shared is not included. Time stamps, hashing, chain of custody, and ensuring malicious files are not included are not part of the EDRM model. Validating that a legal hold is valid should happen before preservation, but validating that documented items from the hold are included if they exist should occur.",
      "C. Removing information relevant to a legal hold is exactly what the hold is intended to prevent. Theresa's organization could be in serious legal trouble if they were to intentionally purge or change related information.",
      "C. Backups are the least volatile of these options according to the order of volatility. Backups will be kept until they are aged out, which may be days, weeks, or even months in some cases. From most to least volatile, these are RAM, data on the hard drive, remote logs, and then backups.",
      "A. Although both a checksum and a hash can be used to validate message integrity, a hash has fewer collisions than a checksum and will also provide a unique fingerprint for a file. Checksums are primarily used as a quick means of checking that that integrity is maintained, whereas hashes are used for many other purposes such as secure password validation without retaining the original password. A checksum would not be useful for proving a forensic image was identical, but it could be used to ensure that your work had not changed the contents of the drive."

      "C. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) implements privacy requirements for handling the personal information of EU residents. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) includes security and privacy rules that affect health-care providers, health insurers, and health information clearinghouses. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) applies to educational institutions. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) applies to credit and debit card information.",
      "B. The five security functions described in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework are identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover.",
      "C. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) publishes ISO 27701, covering privacy controls. ISO 27001 and 27002 cover cybersecurity, and ISO 31000 covers risk management.",
      "D. Policies require approval from the highest level of management, usually the CEO. Other documents may often be approved by other managers, such as the CISO.",
      "C. Master service agreements (MSAs) provide an umbrella contract for the work that a vendor does with an organization over an extended period of time. The MSA typically includes detailed security and privacy requirements. Each time the organization enters into a new project with the vendor, they may then create a statement of work (SOW) that contains project-specific details and references the MSA.",
      "B. All of these organizations produce security standards and benchmarks. However, only the Center for Internet Security (CIS) is known for producing independent benchmarks covering a wide variety of software and hardware.",
      "C. Many organizations use scheduled maintenance windows to coordinate changes to information systems. These windows are preplanned and announced times when all non-emergency changes will take place and often occur on evenings and weekends. A change management process ensures that personnel can perform a security impact analysis. Experts evaluate changes to identify any security impacts before personnel deploy the changes in a production environment. A backout plan allows personnel to undo the change and return the system to its previous state if necessary. Version control ensures that developers and users have access to the latest versions of software and that changes are carefully managed throughout the release process.",
      "B. Security policies do not normally contain prescriptive technical guidance, such as a requirement to use a specific encryption algorithm. This type of detail would normally be found in a security standard.",
      "C. Alice's exercise is designed to evaluate how well employees can identify phishing messages and, if they fail to do so, redirect them to a training program that is meant to help them get better at recognizing such messages. The exercise is meant for educational purposes and not for penalizing employees. It is intended to help them improve their skills in recognizing phishing emails.",
      "While rewarding employees for identifying phishing emails could be a component of a security awareness program, the exercise described is primarily educational and is focused on helping those who fail to recognize the phishing messages.",
      "While data might be collected for analysis and understanding areas where improvement is needed, the intention is not to label departments as gullible.",
      "B. An organization's acceptable use policy (AUP) should contain information on what constitutes allowable and unallowable use of company resources. This policy should contain information to help guide Tonya's next steps.",
      "D. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) provides detailed rules about the storage, processing, and transmission of credit and debit card information. PCI DSS is not a law but rather a contractual obligation that applies to credit card merchants and service providers.",
      "B. As an information security manager, Mike's primary role would be to establish an effective security training and awareness program, promote it within the organization, and ensure it is maintained effectively to foster a security-conscious culture among employees. This aligns with a proactive approach to reducing security incidents. Mike should take an active role in security training and awareness, rather than delegating all responsibilities to another department. While HR may be involved, Mike's expertise is crucial in establishing effective programs.",
      "Although security awareness posters and training sessions are two components of security awareness efforts, Mike's role should be much broader, encompassing the establishment, promotion, and maintenance of comprehensive training and awareness programs.",
      "D. Mandatory vacations are designed to force individuals to take time away from the office to allow fraudulent activity to come to light in their absence. The other controls listed here (separation of duties, least privilege, and dual control) are all designed to prevent, rather than detect, fraud.",
      "D. Guidelines are the only element of the security policy framework that is optional. Compliance with policies, standards, and procedures is mandatory.",
      "A. Security training typically involves structured and formal programs where employees learn new security concepts and practices. In contrast, security awareness efforts are more informal and aim to keep security principles top-of-mind for employees through reminders, without requiring them to engage in formal learning. The idea that security training involves giving rewards to employees and awareness efforts involve punishments is not accurate. Security training is meant to educate employees on security concepts and practices, not to serve as a platform for rewards. Similarly, awareness efforts are not punitive; they serve to remind and reinforce security principles among employees. The statement that there is no difference between security training and awareness efforts and that both terms can be used interchangeably is also incorrect. There is a distinct difference between the two in terms of their structure and purpose, as explained in the correct answer. Lastly, the notion that security training is only for security team members while security awareness is for all employees is not true. Security training is important for all employees, depending on their roles and responsibilities, to ensure they understand the security protocols and policies. Security awareness, on the other hand, is a continual reminder for all employees, including the security team, to stay vigilant and informed about security practices.",
      "B. Standards describe specific security controls that must be in place for an organization. Allan would not include acceptable mechanisms in a high-level policy document, and this information is too general to be useful as a procedure. Guidelines are not mandatory, so they would not be applicable in this scenario.",
      "D. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is designed to help organizations describe their current cybersecurity posture, describe their target state for cybersecurity, identify and prioritize opportunities for improvement, assess progress, and communicate with stakeholders about risk. It does not create specific technology requirements.",
      "C. Requests for an exception to a security policy would not normally include a proposed revision to the policy. Exceptions are documented variances from the policy because of specific technical and/or business requirements. They do not alter the original policy, which remains in force for systems not covered by the exception."

      "B. This is a tricky question, as it is possible that all of these categories of information may be found in patient records. However, they are most likely to contain protected health information (PHI). PHI could also be described as a subcategory of personally identifiable information (PII), but PHI is a better description. It is also possible that the records might contain payment card information (PCI) or personal financial information (PFI), but that is less likely than PHI.",
      "C. Organizations should only use data for the purposes disclosed during the collection of that data. In this case, the organization collected data for technical support purposes and is now using it for marketing purposes. That violates the principle of purpose limitation.",
      "C. Top Secret is the highest level of classification under the U.S. system and, therefore, requires the highest level of security control.",
      "D. Quantitative risk analysis uses numeric data in the analysis, resulting in assessments that allow the very straightforward prioritization of risks. Qualitative risk analysis substitutes subjective judgments and categories for strict numerical analysis, allowing the assessment of risks that are difficult to quantify. A one-time risk assessment offers the organization a point-in-time view of its current risk state. Recurring risk assessments are performed at regular intervals, such as annually or quarterly.",
      "B. Data controllers are the entities who determine the reasons for processing personal information and direct the methods of processing that data. This term is used primarily in European law, and it serves as a substitute for the term data owner to avoid a presumption that anyone who collects data has an ownership interest in that data.",
      "D. The residual risk is the risk that remains after an organization implements controls designed to mitigate, avoid, and/or transfer the inherent risk."
